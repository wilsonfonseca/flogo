	"content": " Project Flogo is an Open Source ecosystem for event-driven apps Project Flogo is an ultra-light, Go-based open source ecosystem for building event-driven apps. Event-driven, you say? Yup, the notion of triggers and actions are leveraged to process incoming events. An action, a common interface, exposes key capabilities such as application integration, stream processing, etc. \n - **App = Trigger(s) + Actions[\u0026Activities]** - **Triggers** - receive data from external sources. - are managed by a configurable threading model - have a common interface enabling anyone to build a Flogo trigger. - **Handlers** - dispatch events to actions - **Actions** - process events in a manner suitable with the implementation - have a common interface enabling opinionated event processing capabilities # Project Flogo Ecosystem All capabilities within the Flogo Ecosystem have a few things in common, they all process events (in a manner suitable for the specific purpose) and they all implement the *action* interface exposed by Flogo Core. Some of the key highlights include: 🎈 **Ultra-light** 20x-50x lighter than Java or Node.js  ⚡️ **Event-driven** Powerful event-driven programming model based on *triggers* and *actions* ⚙️ **Common core** a single, common core enables reuse and flexibility across all eventing constructs ✏️ **Golang based** Written entirely in Golang for efficiency 💪 **Deployment flexibility** Deploy as ultra-lightweight serverless functions, containers or static binaries on IoT edge devices 🧠 **Native machine learning** Purpose built activity for TensorFlow SavedModel inferencing 😍 **100% Open Source** for your dev \u0026 hacking pleasure  Integration Flows Application Integration process engine with conditional branching and a visual development environment Stream Processing a simple pipeline-based stream processing action with event joining capabilities across multiple triggers \u0026amp; aggregation over time windows Contextual Decisioning Declarative Rules for Real-time Contextual Decisions Microgateway Microgateway pattern for conditional, content-based routing, JWT validation, rate limiting, circuit breaking and other common patterns  The concept is simple, an event is just that, an event, how it’s processed is what differs. Flogo Core eases the burden by enabling a common set of functionality, such as:\n threading logging data type coercion data mapping tracing \u0026amp; monitoring hooks  While also exposing a common set of contributions via activities and triggers. For example, all available triggers can be leveraged to dispatch events to any action implementation, that is, flows for application integration, streams for stream processing, rules for contextual rule processing, etc.\nFlogo Core Flogo Core is an event-driven app framework used to develop apps for the cloud \u0026amp; IoT edge. It can also be thought of as a lightweight app kernel used by open source \u0026amp; commercial solutions.\nFlogo Core provides the following key benefits:\n⛓ Action chaining enables communication between one or more capabilities in a single, sub 10MB binary! 🏗 Common contribution model build activities and triggers that can be leveraged by all capabilities 🔨 Extensible easily extend the capabilities available by building your own action using the common interfaces\nFlogo Core Contribution Model Flogo Core exposes three principal contribution interfaces that enable developers to build common capabilities and functionality. These contribution interfaces include:\n Trigger Interface a common interface for building event-consumers that dispatch events to one or more actions. The Kafka subscriber is an example of a trigger. Activity Interface a common interface for exposing common application logic in a reusable manner. Think of this as a function, such as write to database, publish to Kafka, etc that can be used by all Flogo apps. Action Interface a common interface for processing events. Actions contain the specific capability logic, such as integration, stream processing, rule processing, etc. Actions have a great deal of flexibility in how they’re developed and how developers leverage actions within their overall applications. For example, flows and streams expose JSON-based DSLs \u0026amp; Go APIs for maximum developer flexibility.  Repos Project Flogo consists of the following sub-projects available as separate repos:\n flogo-cli: Command line tools for building Flogo apps \u0026amp; extensions flogo-lib: The core Flogo library flogo-services: Backing services required by Flogo flogo-contrib: Flogo contributions/extensions project-flogo/stream: Flogo Streams Action project-flogo/rules: Contextual, deterministic rules action project-flogo/microgateway: Flogo Microgateway Action  Flogo Flows Flogo Flows provides application integration capabilities and includes the following key highlights.\n🌈 Painless development Visual modeler with step-back debugging capabilities \u0026amp; elegant DSL ⚙️ Ultra-light process engine for conditional flow control\nGetting Started We\u0026rsquo;ve made getting started with Flogo Flows as easy as possible. The current set of tooling is designed for:\n Serverless function developers Cloud-native microservices developers IoT Solutions developers Go Developers  Zero-code Developers If your background is in or you prefer to develop your apps using zero-coding environments, then read on, because we’ve got something special for you.\nFlows Web UI is available via Docker Hub or Flogo.io. The Docker image contains the Flows Web UI along with all required components to begin developing, testing and building deployable artifacts right from your web browser.\nTo report any issues with the Issue tracker on this project.\nFlogo Streams Edge devices have the potential for producing millions or even billions of events at rapid intervals, often times the events on their own are meaningless, hence the need to provide basic streaming operations against the slew of events.\nA native streaming action as part of the Project Flogo Ecosystem accomplishes the following primary objectives:\n Enables apps to implement basic streaming constructs in a simple pipeline fashion Provides non-persistent state for streaming operations  Streams are persisted in memory until the end of the pipeline  Serves as a pre-process pipeline for raw data to perform basic mathematical and logical operations. Ideal for feeding ML models  Some of the key highlights include:\n😀 Simple pipeline construct enables a clean, easy way of dealing with streams of data ⏳ Stream aggregation across streams using time or event tumbling \u0026amp; sliding windows 🙌 Join streams from multiple event sources 🌪 Filter out the noise with stream filtering capabilities\nGetting Started We’ve made building powerful streaming pipelines as easy as possible. Develop your pipelines using:\n A simple, clean JSON-based DSL Golang API  See the sample below of an aggregation pipeline (for brevity, the triggers and metadata of the resource has been omitted). Also don’t forget to check out the examples in the project-flogo/stream repo.\n\u0026quot;stages\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/aggregate\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;function\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;sum\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;windowType\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;timeTumbling\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;windowSize\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;5000\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;=$.input\u0026quot; } }, { \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;message\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;=$.result\u0026quot; } } ]  Flogo Rules Processing Events in real-time to determine next best action is an important function of Event driven applications. With the vast amount of events that are generated from different sources, making sense of the information in a given context can be immensely valuable.\nFlogo Rules simplifies the complexity involved with real-time contextual decisions.\nFlogo Rules supports\n Declarative Rules to define conditional logic and trigger result rules Joins/Correlations across multiple Event sources Ability to define Rule Priorities Timer Events; Configurable TTL (time to live) -1 - no expiry, 0 - event expiry set to end of run to completion cycle. Forward chaining for Inferencing  The CLI The CLI is used to build all applications that leverage the JSON-based DSL. If you’re using the Go API to build your apps, feel free to just go build your stuff without the flogo CLI.\nGetting started with the CLI couldn\u0026rsquo;t be any easier (refer to Flogo CLI repo for detail instructions and dependencies):\n Install the CLI\ngo get -u github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-cli/...  Create \u0026amp; build your app  flogo the core CLI for creating and building your applications\n flogogen a scaffolding tool to begin building your Flogo contributions (activities, triggers \u0026amp; actions)\n  If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in building your own contribution(s), refer to the Flogo Documentation or join us on the project-flogo/Lobby Gitter Channel.\nGolang API Are you the kind of person who would rather code, but would love to leverage the capabilities of the Flogo Ecosystem?

These labs provide you with a guides, tutorials and code samples and will help you work through building and deploying Flogo apps. The labs cover a wide range of topics like deploying to Kubernetes, using Flogo with the Serverless Framework and a bunch more! The colors of the cards have a meaning:\nFlogo CLI These labs have an emphasis on using the Flogo CLI to build apps\n Flogo CLI Project Flogo provides two different command-line interfaces and which you need depends on the task you need to execute. This tutorial covers the \u0026#39;flogo\u0026#39; command     AWS Lambda Flogo has first class support for AWS Lambda. This tutorial covers building Lambda apps using the Flogo CLI     Building activities Building new activities to extend the capabilities of Project Flogo is definitely not the most difficult thing on the planet. In fact, it\u0026#39;s rather easy to get you started!     Building triggers Triggers make it possible for Flogo to get data. How do you get started building a trigger, though? Check this tutorial to build a simple trigger.     Build using Go Cheesecakes are important! In fact, we believe perhaps the most important thing, right after Flogo. In this tutorial you\u0026#39;ll build a cheesecake service using the Go API.     Streams: Aggregate Learn how to use the JSON DSL to build streaming pipelines using the power of Flogo.     Streams: Filter Learn how to use the JSON DSL to build a simple streaming pipelines, using the power of Flogo, that filters out all zeros.     Flogo Web UI These labs have an emphasis on using the Flogo Web UI to build apps\n Timers Timers are great to schedule stuff, and a great way to learn new technology! Use this lab to get familiar with some of the concepts of Flogo!     Hello World Hello World! This lab will walk you through building your first API with Project Flogo     Bookstore Who doesn\u0026#39;t like a good book? But what if you really need to get some information about a book first? In that case you build a Flogo app that uses Google APIs to that!     Raspberry Pi Flogo runs perfectly on these small devices, and in this lab you\u0026#39;ll build a sample to read and write data to the GPIO pins of the device to control your home lights!     AWS IoT A device shadow is a digital representation in the cloud that stores and retrieves current state information for a device using AWS IoT.     Invoice Service Let\u0026#39;s build an invoiceservice! In this tutorial we\u0026#39;ll walk you through building an app with several community-driven activities and talks to other services as well.     Payment Service Who doesn\u0026#39;t want to know when payments are coming in? This service generates a payment date that can be used by the invoiceservice or standalone.     External tools These labs have an emphasis on using external tools together with Project Flogo, like Kubernetes or the Serverless Framework\n Kubernetes Kubernetes is probably the most wellknown container orchestration platform out there. In this demo you explore how to run Flogo apps on Kubernetes.     Docker Flogo apps are ultralight, so building docker images is not only really easy, because it can embed all dependencies it can also run inside of super small containers.     Cloud Foundry Cloud Foundry is an open-source platform as a service (PaaS) that provides you with a choice of clouds, developer frameworks, and application services (like Flogo!).     Serverless Framework Developers never have to worry about provisioning or maintaining servers, and only have to create the code that they need to power their next business idea!     PubNub Secure comms with PubNub: Building microservices is cool, having them talk to each other is awesome! But in today\u0026#39;s world, you can\u0026#39;t be too careful when it comes to your data.     IoT apps Flogo can run almost anywhere. Take this lab to get yourself familiar with how to develop IoT apps using the Flogo CLI.     BeagleBone Deploying apps to a BeagleBone     Intel Edison Deploying apps to an Edison     Raspberry Pi (IoT) Deploying apps to a Raspberry Pi     CI/CD for Activities A CI/CD pipeline is really important for proper a proper test and build cycle. This tutorial walks you through how to do that with Jenkins and Travis for Flogo activities.     AWS SAM SAM provides a model to build Serverless apps for AWS. It also provides an easy way of testing your apps without deploying to AWS Lambda all the time...     "

	"content": " Before you begin with the ML Inferencing activity, refer to the Flows \u0026gt; TensorFlow \u0026gt; Getting Started documentation.\nOverview of the Inference Activity The inference activity was built to support the concept of plugable frameworks, however the only supported framework is currently TensorFlow. The activity leverages the Golang API from TensorFlow. You don\u0026rsquo;t need Python or anything other than the TensorFlow dynamic library installed on your dev \u0026amp; target machine.\nInputs model The “model” input to the activity should be either of the following:\n An archive (zip) of the TensorFlow model A directory containing the exported protobuf and check point files  The activity has been tested with the exported model from the tf.estimator.Exporter.export operation as well as manually built models exported with the tf.saved_model module. After export, optionally zip the file, where the saved_model.pb file is located at the root of the archive.\nThe SavedModel format contained in the protobuf includes metadata (interpret this as an instruction manual) on how to use the model. The below inputs and outputs are which parts of the metadata to use to connect to this model.\nfeatures The data to be passed into the SavedModel are defined in “features”. This is an array of maps and should match the following format. For estimators an example of “features” is:\n[ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;inputs\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;:{ \u0026quot;z-axis-q75\u0026quot;: 4.140586, \u0026quot;y-axis-q75\u0026quot;: 4.140586 } } ]  And, for manually build models with multiple inputs “features” would be something like:\n[ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;X1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;:[ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ] }, { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;X2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;:[ [0.1,0.2,0.3], [0.4,0.5,0.6], [0.7,0.8,0.9] ] } ]  framework The deep learning framework to use for inferencing. Currently the only supported value is: Tensorflow\ntag (default: “serve”) and sigDefName (default: “serving_default”) A TensorFlow model consists of a complex graph (network) of mathematical operations that can contain many moving parts. Another way to consider this is that a model consists of connected “computers” that each have a purpose. To use the model we have to know which computer/part of the model to use. “tag” is used to identify within the model metadata which part of the model to use. Once we have selected the “computer” to use we then need to know which “ports” to use. “sigDefName” is used within the model metadata to properly connect Flogo to the model. These Inputs into the inference activity default to the standard values used by TensorFlow.\nOutputs The output is an object and can contain multiple outputs. For example, for a classification model, the scores and classifications will be held in a map:\nmap[scores:[[0.049997408 0.010411096 0.93959147]] classes:[[Jogging Sitting Upstairs]]]  Sample application Refer to the TensorFlow samples\n"

	"content": " For Flogo a Flow is more inline with the concept of a function, that is, a Flow has both input and output parameters. The concept of decoupling a trigger from a flow is a key part of supporting multiple triggers and re-use/sharing of a flow. A Flow can now operate against the data that it has defined within its declartion, it otherwords, just like a function, the scope of data that a Flow can operate against must reside within either the Flow context (or as an environment variable).\nSetting Flow Input and Output Params When building a Flow, you must first define the input and output params, that is, what are the input parameters that a flow can operate against and what parameters will be returned once the Flow has finished executing. To do this, we have options, either use the WebUI or construct the JSON manually.\nFrom the WebUI, open your new Flow, and click the \u0026ldquo;Flow Params\u0026rdquo; box, you\u0026rsquo;ll be presented with the Flow input/output editor.\nYou will be presented with a dialog containing two tabs, Input and Output. Use this dialog to define your input and output parameters.\nIf you intend to perform complex object mapping choose the type \u0026lsquo;object\u0026rsquo; for either an input or output param. This enables you to construct your own JSON, refer to the Flow Mappings section for details.\n If you\u0026rsquo;d prefer to define the Flows input and output params via the application JSON, you may do so\n\u0026quot;actions\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;metadata\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ISBN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string\u0026quot; } ], \u0026quot;output\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;someResponse\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;object\u0026quot; } ] }  Mapping Trigger Output and Reply Because a Flow operates against its own locally scoped data (params), you will need to map the trigger data into the Flow params, as well as the flow params to the triggers reply params(s). This may sound a bit odd at first, however is required to ensure that a trigger is entierly decoupled from a flow, as previously said, enabling flows to be re-used and support multiple paths of invocation via different triggers.\nBefore we jump in, to understand the concepts used here:\n Trigger output: A trigger is an event-driven construct used to invoke a Flow. A trigger will run logic and perpare data that must be used within a Flow. Think of a REST trigger, the output of the trigger to the Flow will be things like the request data, the HTTP headers, etc. Trigger reply: After a Flow has finished executing, it may be desierable to send back data in response to the triggers request. Consider a REST trigger. If the verb was a GET, the reply would be the payload that the trigger must return to the caller.  To map the trigger data using the WebUI, add a trigger to your Flow, and click on it.\nNow select \u0026ldquo;Map flow params\u0026rdquo;.\nNow you can map the output of the trigger to Flow input params, and Flow output params can be mapped to the reply params available for the trigger.\nIf you choose to map directly within the JSON, consider the following triggers definition\n\u0026quot;triggers\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Receive HTTP Message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/trigger/rest\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Simple REST Trigger\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;port\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;9099\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;receive_http_message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;handlers\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;actionMappings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ISBN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;pathParams.ISBN\u0026quot; } ], \u0026quot;output\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;someResponse\u0026quot; } ] }, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;method\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;GET\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/:ISBN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;autoIdReply\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;false\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;useReplyHandler\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;false\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;actionId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;my_flow\u0026quot; } ] } ]  Note the \u0026ldquo;actionMappings\u0026rdquo; within the handler settings.\n"

The activity type must be defined as a type 2, which indicates that it is to be iterated over. Finally, a new settings element has been introduced, this is where you can define the array or literal to iterate over.

It is also possible to define a static value, for example, if the value of \u0026ldquo;10\u0026rdquo; was specified, the iterator construct would invoke this activity 10 times The $current scope has not been introduced and can be used to access the value and key of the current iteration.  The $current scope has two properties:\n $current.iteration.value: The value of the current iteration, that is, the object of the current array $current.iteration.key: The current key (1, 2, etc)  "

	"content": " What are mappings? A mapping in a Flogo Flow can be used to assign the value of a variable to that of an input parameters of an activity or to the value of another flow scoped variable.\nTypes of mappings If you peak under the covers, you\u0026rsquo;ll note that we have a number of different mapping types supported in the Flogo engine. These include:\n   Type Description     assign Direct mapping. Assigning the value from var1 to var2. No other implied logic.   literal A literal mapping. For example, mapping the string \u0026ldquo;hello\u0026rdquo; to a string typed variable.   expression Expression mapping. This enable using functions and expression condition in mamping   object Complex object. Used when a JSON-based complex object must be built and assigned.   array Array mapping. Mapping an Array of Objects.    Types manifest themselves directly in your application json, as follows:\n{ \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ISBN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;assign\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;evt.ISBN\u0026quot; }  The above mapping indicates that the value of evt.ISBN should be mapped to the variable named ISBN. This is a type assign mapping, hence the value of evt.ISBN is assigned directly to ISBN. Consider two additional samples, below you will find a type literal mapping, as well as a complex object type object mapping.\nType literal:\n{ \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ISBN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;literal\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;12937\u0026quot; }  Type object:\n{ \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ISBN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;object\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;ISBN\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;12937\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Author\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{$flow.Author}}\u0026quot; } }  The type literal mapping is pretty simple to understand, however type object does require a bit of an explanation. Note that the value param is assigned an object, not a string, and also note the use of the template style variable injection. You can use \u0026ldquo;{{ }}\u0026rdquo; when you need to inject the value of another object into your complex object. If you assign the value of an array then that param will be treated as an array, likewise for a string, int, etc. For example, let us pretend flow.Author is an array, then the Author object would be an array. In otherwords, direct assignment is occurring.\nThe WebUI insulates you frome much of this understanding and will infer the correct mapping type.\nType expression:\n{ \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;expression\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string.concat(\\\u0026quot;The pet category name is: \\\u0026quot;, $activity[rest_3].result.category.name)\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;data.description\u0026quot; }  The above sample leverages the output of a REST Invoke activity to get a pet from the public petstore service. The first mapper fetches the pet\u0026rsquo;s first[array index] id of tag and assigns the value to the id field of the data attribute and next mapper uses a string concat function string.concat(str1, str2, str3) and assigns function return to the description field.\nType array:\n{ \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;array\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;fields\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.id\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.id\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;primitive\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;primitive\u0026quot; } ], \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$activity[rest_3].result.tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;data.response\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;foreach\u0026quot; } }  To iterate over an array from the output of the previous activities or trigger to the current field of type array by supporting nested arrays and there are no limitation to how deep the array can be.\nThe $$ or $. indicates the current array element object, $.name to get current element\u0026rsquo;s name field.\nMapping Resolvers Flogo will resolve mappings with the following. Note the scopes table below, which indicates what objects are accessible within what scope.\n   Scope Description     $env Used to resolve an environment variable   $property Used to resolve properties from the global application property bag   $flow Used to resolve params from within the current flow. If a flow has a single trigger and no input params defined, then the output of the trigger is made available via $flow   $activity Used to resolve activity params. Activities are referenced by id, for example, $activity[acivity_id].activity_property.   $current Used to resolve data scoped to a current iterator    Mapping Scopes Flogo has the concept of mapping resolvers and resolvers are contained within a specific scope, hence not all objects can be accessed from anywhere within the scope.\n   Mapper Scope     Trigger-\u0026gt;Settings env and property resolvers   Trigger-\u0026gt;Handler-\u0026gt;Settings env and property resolvers   Trigger-\u0026gt;Handler-\u0026gt;actionMapper/input Trigger ouput \u0026lt;\u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo; field - only property and env resolver can be used. That is, only the output of the trigger or an environment variable can be used here.   Trigger-\u0026gt;Handler-\u0026gt;actionMapper/output action scope. Properties defined as ahe output of the flow can be used.   Action-\u0026gt;Flow-\u0026gt;Activity-\u0026gt;inputMapper/input flow \u0026lt;\u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo; field - all resolvers can be used   Action-\u0026gt;Flow-\u0026gt;Activity-\u0026gt;inputMapper/output activity input   Action-\u0026gt;Flow-\u0026gt;Activity-\u0026gt;outputMapper/input activity output   Action-\u0026gt;Flow-\u0026gt;Activity-\u0026gt;outputMapper/output flow   Link Expression all resolvers can be used for link expressions.    Mapping Syntax Flogo leverages a few simple syntax paradigms when mapping. The first being, the $ character is used when accessing/reading someone not within the immediate scope. For example, consider the following mapping.\n\u0026quot;actionMappings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ISBN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;assign\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;pathParams.ISBN\u0026quot; } ]  The above mapping is from the Trigger/Handler, which we know, based on the resolver, we can only access trigger scoped (output) variables, thus pathParam is within the trigger scope and does not need any special characters when accessing.\nWhat is you\u0026rsquo;re accessing someone out of the immediate scope? The mapping should be prefixed with the $ special character, indicating to the resolver that we\u0026rsquo;re accessing someone out of the immediate scope. For example, consider the following.\n\u0026quot;inputMappings\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;assign\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$flow.ISBN\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;message\u0026quot; } ]  This mapping is associated with Action-\u0026gt;Flow-\u0026gt;Activity-\u0026gt;inputMapper. We know that all resolvers can be used within the context, however none of the variables would be within the immediate scope, hence the $ should be used. For example, in the above snippet, we\u0026rsquo;re grabbing the value of the flow variable named ISBN, hence $flow.ISBN is used. If we wanted to grab the value of an environment variable we could use $env.VarName.\nAccessing object properties Most of the time you wont want to perform a direct assigning from one complex object to another, rather you\u0026rsquo;ll want to grab a simple type property from one complex object and perform a direct assigning to another property. This can be done accessing children using a simple dot notation. For example, consider the following mapping.\n{ \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;someResponse\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;object\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Title\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{$activity[rest_3].result.items[0].volumeInfo.title}}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;PublishedDate\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{$activity[rest_3].result.items[0].volumeInfo.publishedDate}}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{$activity[rest_3].result.items[0].volumeInfo.description}}\u0026quot; } }  First note that this is from a Return activity, which is mapping a complex object (type object) to a flow paramater named someResponse. The object we\u0026rsquo;re accessing is from the response of an activity, this is fetched using the $activity scope. Consider one of the examples:\n$activity[rest_3].result.items[0].volumeInfo.title\nWe\u0026rsquo;re referencing the result property from the activity named rest_3. We\u0026rsquo;re then accessing an items array (the first entry of the array) to another complex object, where finally we\u0026rsquo;re at a simple string property named title.\nUsing functions and expression Most of time you want to add some custome logic to the mapping, such as concat/substring/length of a string or generate a random number base on a range and so on. any logic you want to add you can come up with an function. Here are object exmaple of function we have today\n   Function Name Description Return Type     string.concat() Returns the concatenation of the arguments. You can concatenate two or more strings. Eg: string.concat(\u0026ldquo;Hello\u0026rdquo;,\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;, \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rdquo;) string   string.equals() Returns whether those two string are equals. Eg: string.equals(\u0026ldquo;TIBCO FLOGO\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;TIBCO FLOGO\u0026rdquo;, false) boolean   string.length() Returns the length of a string. Eg: string.length(\u0026ldquo;TIBCO FLOGO\u0026rdquo;) integer   number.random() Generates a pseudo-random integer number between 0 and the specified limit. Eg: number.random(10) integer    { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;expression\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string.concat(\\\u0026quot;The pet category name is: \\\u0026quot;, $activity[rest_3].result.category.name)\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;data.description\u0026quot; }  The function or expression condition can also use to link expreesion in branch, any functions that return a boolean can use in link expression.\n{ \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;rest_3\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: 3, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;log_5\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$activity[rest_3].result.category.name == \\\u0026quot;BOOK\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot; } or { \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;rest_3\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: 3, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;log_5\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: 1, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string.length($activity[rest_3].result.category.name) \u0026gt;= 10\u0026quot; }  Hanlding arrays in mappings There are lots of use cases for array mapping, map entire array to another or iterator partial array to another with functions The array mapping value comes from a JSON format\n{ \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$activity[rest_3].result.tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;data.response\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;foreach\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;fields\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.id\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.id\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;primitive\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string.concat($activity[rest_4].result.category.name, $.name)\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;primitive\u0026quot; } ] }   from: Previous activity\u0026rsquo;s array output field to: current activity\u0026rsquo;s input array field type: foreach indicate iterator array element fields: list all element field that use to iterator and assign.  from: the value comes from to: to the current element, $. indicate current element. type: The type either primitive or foreach. foreach mean another array mapping. nest array support without deep limitation   If you want to only create one element of array. using NEWARRAY for from field.\n{ \u0026quot;fields\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10001\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.id\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;primitive\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$activity[rest].result.category.name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;primitive\u0026quot; } ], \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;NEWARRAY\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;data.response\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;foreach\u0026quot; }  Note: You can use any literal string, functions, expression in from under fields node.\nRecap  A mapping without a special character indicates a locally scoped object A mappig with the $ indicates an object outside of the current scope Flow properties are accessible via: $flow. Activity output properties/objects are accessible via: $activity[].property Envrionment variables are accessible via: $env  "

	"content": " tibco-lambda The Lambda trigger provides your Flogo application the ability to start flows running as an AWS Lambda function.\nHow it works In Lambda, functions can be triggered by a variety of event sources (like Amazon S3, or the Amazon API Gateway) and in Lambda terms, each of them would need a specific method to serve as starting point. To overcome that, and make it possible to create just one flow that can be triggered by multiple events, the Lambda trigger abstracts the incoming event, making sure that no change is needed when you want to hook up other events to the same trigger.\nInstallation Flogo Web This activity comes out of the box with the Flogo Web UI\nFlogo CLI flogo install trigger github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/trigger/lambda  Schema Settings, Outputs:\n{ \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: [ ], \u0026quot;output\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;context\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;object\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;evt\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;object\u0026quot; } ] }  Context The context object contains details about the Flogo app and the runtime\n{ \u0026quot;awsRequestId\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;6301513f-c5c5-11e8-9997-c9e96bfbdd33\u0026quot;, \u0026lt;-- The request ID that AWS associated with the Lambda execution \u0026quot;functionName\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;TestApp\u0026quot;, \u0026lt;-- The name of the app that was triggered \u0026quot;functionVersion\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;$LATEST\u0026quot;, \u0026lt;-- The version of the function that is executed \u0026quot;logGroupName\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;/aws/lambda/TestApp\u0026quot;, \u0026lt;-- The name of the log group in AWS CloudWatch where logs are sent to \u0026quot;logStreamName\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2018/10/01/[$LATEST]ec9b2c81da4b4307ab50738bb1eeb28f\u0026quot;, \u0026lt;-- The logstream to which events are sent \u0026quot;memoryLimitInMB\u0026quot;:128 \u0026lt;-- The amount of RAM your function has available }  Example events The events themselves are not changed by the Lambda trigger, though without changing your Lambda code a single app can handle multiple types of events.

This command tells the flogo cli to build the app as an embedded application (the -e option) and with a target shim (the -shim option which uses the trigger id). The AWS Lambda trigger leverages a makefile to kick off the build process, which simply builds your Flogo application using the Lambda trigger shim and zips the binary for deployment to AWS Lambda.\nOnce this command finishes successfully the zip file (handler.zip) will be located in your app src directory (for example /path/to/app/lambda/src/lambda/handler.zip).\nDeploy There are several ways to deploy to AWS Lambda. A non-exhaustive list is:\n Uploading the code Using SAM templates Using Serverless Framework Using the AWS CLI  In this scenario we\u0026rsquo;ll look at numbers 1 and 4\nUploading the code From the Lambda console you can easily create a new function. As you do that set the runtime to Go 1.x, upload the zip file and set the handler to handler.\nUsing the AWS CLI To deploy your app using the AWS CLI go to the directory where the zip was created and from there execute the command\naws lambda create-function --function-name tutorial --runtime go1.x --role arn:aws:iam::\u0026lt;account\u0026gt;:role/\u0026lt;role name\u0026gt; --handler handler --zip-file \u0026quot;fileb://handler.zip\u0026quot;  This will create a new function in Lambda called tutorial, which uses the Go runtime. The \u0026ndash;role arn:aws:iam:::role/ is the full ARN of the IAM role used to deploy this function.

	"content": " Are you interested in contributing to Project Flogo? If so, this doc was created specifically for you! If you’re not ready to start contributing code, no problem, feel free to check out the documentation issues and begin by helping enhance the documentation!\nDetailed instructions on contributing to the documentation and sharing your projects via the showcase can be found in our documentation, here:\nhttps://tibcosoftware.github.io/flogo/contributing/\nIf you’re ready and interested to make code contributions, we’ve tried to make the process as easy as possible. First, an automated contributor license agreement (CLA) has been put in place, after your first pull request, you’ll be prompted to sign the agreement, no hassles, easy and integrated right into GitHub. Also, before you begin, take a look at the general guidelines below for contributing.\nHow do I make a contribution? Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in our project? Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick rundown!\nIf you have any questions, feel free to post an issue and tag it as a question, email flogo-oss@tibco.com or chat with the team and community:\n The project-flogo/Lobby Gitter channel should be used for general discussions, start here for all things Flogo! The project-flogo/developers Gitter channel should be used for developer/contributor focused conversations.\n Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add. Look for issues labeled good first issue, kind/help-wanted if you’re unsure where to begin. Don’t forget to checkout all of the Flogo repositories: flogo-contrib, flogo-lib, flogo-cli \u0026amp; flogo-services.\n Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub account. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under github-username/repository-name.\n Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git.\n Create a new branch for your fix using git checkout -b branch-name-here.\n Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.\n Use git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here to add the file contents of the changed files to the \u0026ldquo;snapshot\u0026rdquo; git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.\n Use git commit -m \u0026quot;Insert a short message of the changes made here\u0026quot; to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.\n Push the changes to the remote repository using git push origin branch-name-here.\n Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.\n Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like: \u0026ldquo;Registering mapper functions as outlined in #4352\u0026rdquo;.\n In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainers.\n Sign the CLA if you have not yet done so in the past.\n Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainers.\n Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.\n Congratulations, you’ve contributed to Project Flogo, a celebration is in order!\n  Best Practices for Code Contributions If you\u0026rsquo;re adding a new feature, such as an activity or trigger, please follow the best practices below:\n Provide test cases for your feature Package name should match your activity dir. For example, if a new activity is placed in activity/awesomeActivity then the go package name should match.  Follow Go best practices for package names: https://blog.golang.org/package-names  Run gofmt to format your code Leverage activity trigger metadata (activity/trigger.json)  Use metadata ‘required’ attribute when the attribute is required Supply a default value in metadata not code (use the value attribute)  Activity Eval() should return true only when completed successfully \u0026amp; err should be returned when an error occurs  Refer to the Flogo Documentation for more guidence and help.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget, if you build an awesome Activity or Trigger you can share your work via the Flogo Showcase rather than contributing to flogo-contrib.\n"

	"content": " Flogo terminology and constructs, defined here, all in one place in a logical order vs alphabetical.\nApp An application in Flogo terms is comprised of one or more triggers and flows (actions). The application itself is really just an organizational mechanism that can be leveraged when developing microservices \u0026amp; functions. An application contains a set of configurations, as well as triggers and a collection of flows.\nTrigger Flogo is an event-driven framework. A trigger is the entrypoint for events. A trigger can be a subscriber on an MQTT topic, Kafka topic, HTTP REST interface or a specific IoT sensor. The trigger is responsible for accepting the incoming event and invoking one or more defined actions (flows).\nTriggers are not coupled to flows, that is, a flow can exist without a trigger.\nHandlers The trigger handler is used to map triggers to actions (flows) for processing. A trigger can have one or more handlers that can route events to different flows.\nAction As stated in the triggers section above, Flogo is an event-driven framework. Incoming events can be mapped to an action. An action is a generic implementation for processing the incoming event. Different types of actions can be implemented, thus defining different methods by which an incoming event can be processed.\nToday, only a single action type has been implemented - the Flow.\nFlow A flow is an implementation of an action and is the primary tool to implement business logic in Flogo. A flow can consist of a number of different constructs:\n One or more activities that implement specific logic (for example write to a database, invoke a REST endpoint, etc) Each activity is connected via a link Links can contain conditional logic to alter the path of a flow  Flows, as previously stated in the triggers section, can exist without a trigger. Thus, flows operate very similar to functions, that is, a single flow can define its own input \u0026amp; output parameters. Thus, enabling a flow to be reused regardless of the trigger entrypoint. All logic in the flow only operates against the following data:\n Flow input parameters Environment variables Application properties The output data from activities referenced in the flow  The flow cannot access trigger data directly, trigger input and output data must be mapped into the flows input and output parameters. Refer to Development \u0026gt; Flows \u0026gt; Mappings\nMapping The phrase mapping occurs quite often and refers to the concept of taking properties from one object and associating them with properties of another object. For example, consider object A exposes two properties and activity B accepts only a single input parameter, the two properties need to be concatenated (for example) and \u0026lsquo;mapped\u0026rsquo; into the single input of activity B.\nActivity An activity is the unit of work that can be leveraged within a Flow. An activity can be any number of things and can be compared to a simple function in Go or any other procedural language, that is, an activity accepts input params and will return one or more objects on return, both input \u0026amp; output params are defined by the activity metadata.\n"

	"content": " A device shadow is a digital representation in the cloud that stores and retrieves current state information for a device. You can get and set the state of a device over MQTT or HTTP, even if the device isn\u0026rsquo;t connected to the Internet.\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need The Flogo Web UI This demo makes use of the Flogo Web UI. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have that one running yet, please check out Getting Started with the Flogo Web UI\nCertificates The AWS IoT Device Shadow service requires a very specific setup to make use of SSL certificates. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to download the AWS IoT certificate and private key files. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to put everything in a special folder too, but you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to do that later.\nStep 1: Create the app Open the Flogo Web UI and from there, click \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; to create a new microservice and give your new app a name. Click \u0026ldquo;Create a Flow\u0026rdquo; to create a new flow and give it any name that you want. Now click on the flow you just created and to open the canvas where you can design your flow.\nStep 2: Add a trigger Triggers are used to signal a flow to run. In this case you want to receive an HTTP message to update the device shadow. To add a trigger, click on the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; icon on the left hand side of the screen and select the Receive HTTP Message trigger.\nThe response to the HTTP request will be a message and the HTTP status code, and to be able to send data back you\u0026rsquo;ll need to have Output parameters. You can create them by clicking on the grey \u0026ldquo;Input Output\u0026rdquo; bar on your screen. From there, select Output and configure two parameters:\n Parameter name: code Type: integer  Now click on the + sign to add a new parameter\n Parameter name: message Type: string  Now it is time to configure the trigger to listen to HTTP messages. To start, click on the trigger and a new dialog will open with a bunch of options. In this dialog you\u0026rsquo;ll have to provide:\n Port: The port on which your app will listen (set this to 9233) Method: The HTTP method that will trigger this flow (set this to GET) Path: The path that will route the messages to this flow (this can be anything, like /awsiot/status)  After that, click on \u0026ldquo;Map to flow outputs\u0026rdquo; to map the output parameters you created earlier to the response of the trigger. The code parameter will already be selected, so click on \u0026ldquo;123 code\u0026rdquo; in the Flow Output section to create the mapping. Now click on \u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo; in the Trigger Response section and select \u0026ldquo;* data\u0026rdquo; from the Flow Output section to create the mapping. Click \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo; to make sure everything is, well…, saved. You can click the little X on the top-right (no, not your browser…) to close the dialog window and go back to the flow.\nStep 3: Add activities You’ll have to add some acvitivities to the flow for it to do something. To add an activity click on the large + sign\nA list with all the activities the Flogo Web UI knows about will appear. From the list you can pick the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity (or use the searchbar to find it) and click it to make sure it is added to the flow. As you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In this window you can configure the inputs of the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity. Click on \u0026ldquo;a.. message\u0026rdquo; and type Received Rest request and starting trigger. in the box (on the right hand side of the screen).\nIn the same way you just added the Log activity, now add a Update AWS Device Shadow activity and configure it in the same way with:\n thing: flogo_test (or the name of the device shadow you want to update) awsEndpoint: the MQTT endpoint for your device shadow desired: A JSON representation of the desired state of your device (for example {\u0026quot;switch\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;on\u0026quot;}) reported: A JSON representation of the current state of your device (for example {\u0026quot;switch\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;off\u0026quot;})  This will tell the AWS IoT device shadow to update the reported state into the desired state and as soon as the thing connects to AWS IoT it will receive the new desired state and try to update itself.\nAdd another Log Message activity, but this time with the message Set Report to off and desired to on\nStep 4: Return to sender To complete the app, add a Return activity. Hover over it to see the cog and select configure to bring up the modal to configure the activity. The return activity is always the last activity in a branch and sets the values that are returned to the trigger. Click on \u0026ldquo;123 code\u0026rdquo; and type 200 in the input field to set the HTTP Response code to 200. Now click on \u0026ldquo;a.. message\u0026rdquo; and type \u0026quot;AWS IOT update successful\u0026quot; in the input field (the quotes are needed). Finally click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; to complete the mapping.\nWith all the updates, your flow should look something like the one below.\nStep 5: Build Those were all the steps needed to design the flow, now let\u0026rsquo;s build an executable from it. On the main screen of your flow click on the \u0026lt; button on the top-left hand side of the screen. Click on build and select your operating system of choice!\nStep 6: Run To run the app you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create on the below structure on disk:\n├── \u0026lt;app\u0026gt; \u0026lt;-- Your Flogo app ├── things \u0026lt;-- A folder called things │ ├── root-CA.pem.crt \u0026lt;-- The AWS IoT root certificate (you'll have to rename it to 'root-CA.pem.crt') │ ├── flogo \u0026lt;-- The name of the thing name (in this case the thing would be called flogo) │ │ ├── device.pem.crt \u0026lt;-- The AWS IoT device certificate (you'll have to rename it to 'device.pem.crt') │ │ ├── device.pem.key \u0026lt;-- The AWS IoT private key (you'll have to rename it to 'device.pem.key')  After you start the app, you can send POST requests to it like curl --request GET --url http://localhost:9233/awsiot/status --header 'content-type: application/json' --data '{\u0026quot;switch\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;on\u0026quot;}'\n"

From the screen where you are now, select Output and configure two parameters:\n Parameter name: code Type: integer  Now click on the + sign to add a new parameter\n Parameter name: message Type: any  Now it is time to configure the trigger to listen to HTTP messages. To start, click on the trigger and a new dialog will open with a bunch of options. In this dialog you\u0026rsquo;ll have to provide:\n Port: The port on which your app will listen (set this to 9233) Method: The HTTP method that will trigger this flow (set this to GET) Path: The path that will route the messages to this flow (set this to /books/:isbn, the :isbn means that you can use that as a path parameter in your mappings).  After that, click on \u0026ldquo;Map to flow inputs\u0026rdquo; to map the isbn from the HTTP trigger to the \u0026ldquo;isbn\u0026rdquo; parameter we created earlier. The parameter will already be selected because it is the only one. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to concatenate isbn: with the actual number so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to type (or paste) the following string.concat(\u0026quot;isbn:\u0026quot;, $.pathParams.isbn).\nNow for the outputs, click on \u0026ldquo;Map to flow outputs\u0026rdquo; to map the output parameters you created earlier to the response of the trigger. The code parameter will already be selected, so click on \u0026ldquo;123 code\u0026rdquo; in the Flow Output section to create the mapping. Now click on \u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo; in the Trigger Response section and select \u0026ldquo;* data\u0026rdquo; from the Flow Output section to create the mapping. Click \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo; to make sure everything is, well…, saved. You can click the little X on the top-right (no, not your browser…) to close the dialog window and go back to the flow.\nStep 3: Adding activities You’ll have to add some acvitivities to the flow for it to do something. To add an activity click on the large + sign\nOn the right-hand side of the screen a list with all the activities the Flogo Web UI knows about will appear. From the list you can pick the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity and click it to make sure it is added to the flow. As you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In this window you can configure the inputs of the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity using data from all other activities and triggers in your flow. Right now, you only have the incoming data from the HTTP trigger. To make the log message a little more useful you can concatenate things together like in the HTTP trigger. To do so select the concat function from the string category (see #1), which will put a new function in the window. Now replace str1 with \u0026quot;Getting book data for: \u0026quot;, as that will be the first part of the message to log (see #2). The second part will be the isbn. To get the isbn on the place of str2, select str2 first and after that expand the \u0026ldquo;flow (flow)\u0026rdquo; section (by clicking on the little black caret) and click \u0026ldquo;a.. isbn\u0026rdquo; (see #3). That will enter the selected value on the place of str2 (see #4).\nStep 4: Invoking a REST service The Google API for books is a REST service. To invoke a REST service you can add a new Invoke REST Service activity. As you hover over it to configure the values, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice this activity has a lot more fields you can configure. For now the configuration should be:\n method: \u0026quot;GET\u0026quot; (to get data from the API) uri: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes (the URL of the service you want to call) queryParams: {\u0026quot;q\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;{{$flow.isbn}}\u0026quot;} (this appends a query parameter called q with the value of the isbn to the URL)  Step 5: Return data To complete the flow, add a Return activity. Hover over it to see the cog and select configure to bring up the modal to configure the activity. The return activity is always the last activity in a branch and sets the values that are returned to the trigger. Click on \u0026ldquo;123 code\u0026rdquo; and type 200 in the input field to set the HTTP Response code to 200.\nNow click on \u0026ldquo;* message\u0026rdquo; and type (or copy) the structure below. Finally click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; to complete the mapping.\n{ \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{$activity[rest_3].result.items[0].volumeInfo.title}}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;publishedDate\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{$activity[rest_3].result.items[0].volumeInfo.publishedDate}}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{$activity[rest_3].result.items[0].volumeInfo.description}}\u0026quot; }  The above snippet maps the values from the REST service to fields that are sent back to the trigger. The mapping is done in a JavaScript-like syntax, so $activity[rest_3].result.items[0].volumeInfo.title means it will get the first result (arrays start with 0) and from that result get the volumeInfo element and from that get the title element. The double curly braces are used as by Go\u0026rsquo;s templating engine.\nYour final flow should look something like the one below.\nStep 6: Build Those were all the steps needed to design the flow, now let\u0026rsquo;s build an executable from it. On the main screen of your flow click on the \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;\u0026rdquo; button on the top-left hand side of the screen. That will bring you back to your microservice and from here you can select \u0026ldquo;Build\u0026rdquo;. Choose whichever operating system you\u0026rsquo;re running on to download the executable.\nStep 7: Run To see the results, start your app and run curl --request GET --url http://localhost:9233/books/0747532699. That will give you the details on Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0026rsquo;s Stone\n"

To build a flogo app from the source that you can run on AWS Lambda we\u0026rsquo;ll need to execute a command that is very similar to the one we had in the cli tutorial, but with some added parameters. The command you need to run is flogo build -e -shim start_flow_as_a_function_in_lambda, which tells the flogo cli to build the app as an embedded application (the -e option) and with a target shim (the -shim option which uses the trigger id). The AWS Lambda trigger leverages a makefile to kick off the build process, which simply builds your Flogo application using the Lambda trigger shim and zips the binary for deployment to AWS Lambda.\nOnce this command finishes successfully the zip file (handler.zip) will be in the src directory.\nStep 3: AWS Lambda Great! So we\u0026rsquo;ve built the zip that we need to deploy to Lambda and that is exactly what we\u0026rsquo;ll do in this step.\nIAM policies and roles Generally speaking it is a good idea to create separate IAM users for deploying to AWS. This allows you to explicitly control which resources a Lambda function can use. For now, you can make use of any IAM user that has the ability to deploy to AWS Lambda and you\u0026rsquo;ll need the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for this step.\nAs you go on with building apps for Lambda we do strongly recommend looking atht the AWS IAM documentation to find out which policies you need to set for your IAM user.\nFor this tutorial we\u0026rsquo;ll also assume that you have an IAM role with enough permissions to create a Lambda function. If you\u0026rsquo;ve used the AWS Lambda console, there will likely be an IAM role called lambda_basic_execution which you can use for this tutorial. In any case you\u0026rsquo;ll need the ARN of this role later in this step (which you can find in the IAM console).\nConfigure AWS CLI Run the command aws configure to start the configuration of your AWS CLI. You\u0026rsquo;ll be asked to provide:\n AWS Access Key ID AWS Secret Access Key Default region name (the region you want to deploy to, like us-west-2) Default output format (the output format you want, like json)  Deploy your app To deploy your app go to the directory where the zip was created. From here you can execute the command aws lambda create-function --function-name tutorial --runtime go1.x --role arn:aws:iam::\u0026lt;account\u0026gt;:role/\u0026lt;role name\u0026gt; --handler handler --zip-file \u0026quot;fileb://handler.zip\u0026quot;. This will create a new function in Lambda called tutorial, which uses the Go runtime. The \u0026ndash;role arn:aws:iam:::role/ is the full ARN of the IAM role used to deploy this function. If all went well you\u0026rsquo;ll see a JSON response like this:\n{ \u0026quot;TracingConfig\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Mode\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;PassThrough\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;CodeSha256\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;KzHoXLnTXi9uMugXAOLrMHq6qJ6RimzYdNfrWXIxwLw=\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;FunctionName\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;tutorial\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;CodeSize\u0026quot;: 4026592, \u0026quot;RevisionId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;94b184e5-74e3-4881-abf5-debad47541b5\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MemorySize\u0026quot;: 128, \u0026quot;FunctionArn\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;arn:aws:lambda:\u0026lt;region\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;account\u0026gt;:function:tutorial\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$LATEST\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Role\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;arn:aws:iam::\u0026lt;account\u0026gt;:role/\u0026lt;role\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Timeout\u0026quot;: 3, \u0026quot;LastModified\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2018-05-12T19:30:41.116+0000\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Handler\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;handler\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Runtime\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;go1.x\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; }  Step 4: Testing The only thing left is to test your function. To do that log into AWS and select \u0026ldquo;Lambda\u0026rdquo;, you\u0026rsquo;ll be presented with all the functions you\u0026rsquo;ve deployed so far and one of them will be called tutorial. Click on that, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see the overview of your function, including a large button that says \u0026ldquo;Test\u0026rdquo;. Click \u0026ldquo;Test\u0026rdquo; to configure a new test event. The input for the test event should be (you can replace \u0026ldquo;world\u0026rdquo; with any name or message you want)\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;World\u0026quot; }  From there, click \u0026ldquo;Test\u0026rdquo; and the execution logs will display the result\n{ \u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;World\u0026quot; }  And the log output\nSTART RequestId: 4f26990d-561d-11e8-96ca-bb9eb4465310 Version: $LATEST 2018-05-12 19:47:31.969 INFO [trigger-flogo-lambda] - Starting AWS Lambda Trigger 2018/05/12 19:47:31 Starting AWS Lambda Trigger 2018/05/12 19:47:31 Received evt: 'map[name:World]' 2018/05/12 19:47:31 Received ctx: 'map[logStreamName:2018/05/12/[$LATEST]7f886628e07a4256b0f411b6cd3b6915 memoryLimitInMB:128 awsRequestId:4f26990d-561d-11e8-96ca-bb9eb4465310 functionName:tutorial functionVersion:$LATEST logGroupName:/aws/lambda/tutorial]' 2018-05-12 19:47:31.969 INFO [activity-flogo-log] - Hello World $flow.nameEND RequestId: 4f26990d-561d-11e8-96ca-bb9eb4465310 REPORT RequestId: 4f26990d-561d-11e8-96ca-bb9eb4465310\tDuration: 1.63 ms\tBilled Duration: 100 ms Memory Size: 128 MB\tMax Memory Used: 23 MB  As you\u0026rsquo;re glancing over the results, also look at the Duration and Max Memory Used.

The Flogo app has a REST trigger which listens on port 9233 and the HTTP path /test/:name (where :name is a parameter you can fill in).\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Tutorial\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;flogo:app\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0.0.1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;appModel\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.0.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;triggers\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;receive_http_message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/trigger/rest\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Receive HTTP Message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Simple REST Trigger\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;port\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;9233\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;handlers\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;action\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/action/flow\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;flowURI\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;res://flow:http_flow\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;mappings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;assign\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.pathParams.name\u0026quot; } ], \u0026quot;output\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;assign\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.greeting\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;code\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;literal\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: 200 } ] } }, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;method\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;GET\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/test/:name\u0026quot; } } ] } ], \u0026quot;resources\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;flow:http_flow\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;HTTPFlow\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;metadata\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string\u0026quot; } ], \u0026quot;output\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;greeting\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string\u0026quot; } ] }, \u0026quot;tasks\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;log_2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Log Message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Simple Log Activity\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;activity\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;message\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;flowInfo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;false\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;addToFlow\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;false\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;mappings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;expression\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string.concat(\\\u0026quot;Hello \\\u0026quot;, $flow.name)\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;message\u0026quot; } ] } } }, { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;actreturn_3\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Return\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Simple Return Activity\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;activity\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/actreturn\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;mappings\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;expression\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string.concat(\\\u0026quot;Hello \\\u0026quot;, $flow.name)\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;greeting\u0026quot; } ] } } } ], \u0026quot;links\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;log_2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;actreturn_3\u0026quot; } ] } } ] }  Step 2: Building an app To create the source code simply execute flogo create -f flogo.json myapp. This tells the Flogo CLI to take the flogo.json file and create the source for the app in a folder called myapp. It will also download a few Go packages that the app will need.\nThe next step is to build the executable and for that we need to be in the directory myapp (cd myapp). To build a flogo app from the source you can execute the command flogo build -e, which tells the flogo cli to build the app (and place it in a bin directory) and embed all configuration into a single executable\nStep 3: Running the app You have just built the Flogo app, so now you can test it. From the bin directory (cd bin) you can run ./myapp which will start the app. In the terminal you\u0026rsquo;ll see something like\n2018-05-12 04:34:56.434 INFO [engine] - Engine Starting... 2018-05-12 04:34:56.435 INFO [engine] - Starting Services... 2018-05-12 04:34:56.435 INFO [engine] - Started Services 2018-05-12 04:34:56.435 INFO [engine] - Starting Triggers... 2018-05-12 04:34:56.435 INFO [engine] - Trigger [ receive_http_message ]: Started 2018-05-12 04:34:56.435 INFO [engine] - Triggers Started 2018-05-12 04:34:56.435 INFO [engine] - Engine Started  To test it we\u0026rsquo;ll use the curl command line tool, which is installed on most Operating Systems. From a new terminal window execute the command curl http://localhost:9233/test/flogo. It will send an HTTP request to the app on port 9233 (which was configured in the flogo.json file). In the second terminal you will see the result of the flow (Hello flogo) and when you go back to the first terminal you had, you\u0026rsquo;ll see there are additional lines in your window that indicate a flow has been executed. Now try it out with your own name and see what happens :)\n2018-05-12 04:35:00.632 INFO [trigger-flogo-rest] - Received request for id 'receive_http_message' 2018-05-12 04:35:00.632 INFO [engine] - Running FlowAction for URI: 'res://flow:http_flow' 2018-05-12 04:35:00.633 INFO [activity-flogo-log] - Hello flogo 2018-05-12 04:35:00.633 INFO [engine] - Flow instance [29db1cc55a96c27c280227b2d7b8be82] Completed Successfully 2018-05-12 04:35:15.364 INFO [trigger-flogo-rest] - Received request for id 'receive_http_message' 2018-05-12 04:35:15.364 INFO [engine] - Running FlowAction for URI: 'res://flow:http_flow' 2018-05-12 04:35:15.364 INFO [activity-flogo-log] - Hello leon 2018-05-12 04:35:15.365 INFO [engine] - Flow instance [2adb1cc55a96c27c280227b2d7b8be82] Completed Successfully  "

The project-flogo/developers Developer/contributor focused conversations.  Generate the basic framework The easiest way to start creating activities is to have the flogogen CLI create the basic framework for you. The flogogen CLI takes two important parameters to create the framework for activities. In this tutorial you\u0026rsquo;ll build an activity that takes 2 input parameters (name and salutation) and logs that to the console. It will also return the concatenation of the two fields to you. To start you need to use flogogen to create the scaffolding:\nflogogen activity \u0026lt; name \u0026gt;  The parameters are:\n activity: because you want to create an activity \u0026lt; name \u0026gt;: the name for your new activity (in this example you\u0026rsquo;ll use HelloWorld as the name for the activity)  So to generate our scaffolding, you need to execute the command:\nflogogen activity HelloWorld  The flogogen command will create a folder called HelloWorld and generate the files you need to implement your logic:\nHelloWorld ├── activity.go \u0026lt;-- The implementation of your activity ├── activity.json \u0026lt;-- The metadata of your activity └── activity_test.go \u0026lt;-- A file used to test your activity  The metadata The first step is to update the file activity.json, which has the metadata for your new Flogo activity, with proper information. The metadata describes to the Flogo engine what the activity is called, what the version of the activity is and a few other things. The elements in the file are:\n name: The name of the activity (this should match the name of the folder the activity is in, like HelloWorld) version: The version of the activity (it is recommended to use semantic versioning for your activities) type: This describes to the Flogo engine what kind of contribution this is (this should be activity in this case) ref: The Flogo engine is based on Go and this field is the \u0026ldquo;import\u0026rdquo; path for Go apps (generally speaking this should match your repository) description: A brief description of your activity (this is displayed in the Flogo Web UI) author: This is you! inputs: An array of name/type pairs that describe the input to the activity outputs: An array of name/type pairs that describe the output to the activity  Since you\u0026rsquo;ll want to provide some inputs, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to update the inputs and outputs section\n The inputs section needs a salutation and name (both should be of type string) The outputs section needs a parameter called result (should be of type string)  Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to update the author, ref, and description fields, as well!\n The updated activity.json will look quite similar to the below one.\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;HelloWorld\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0.0.1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;flogo:activity\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/yourusername/yourrepository\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Say Hello World!\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;author\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Flogo Developer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;inputs\u0026quot;:[ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;salutation\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string\u0026quot; } ], \u0026quot;outputs\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;result\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string\u0026quot; } ] }  The logic For the Flogo engine to actually do something we need to update the *.go files. There are two files in your current directory:\n activity.go: which contains the actual activity implementation in go activity_test.go: which contains unit tests for the activity  The first step is to look at the business logic, in the activity.go file.\nAs you want to log the output to the console you\u0026rsquo;ll need to import a new Go package github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/logger and add a new variable called log to the main part of the file\nvar log = logger.GetLogger(\u0026quot;activity-helloworld\u0026quot;)  For the activity itself the only mandatory function that needs to be implemented is the Eval() method. In that method you\u0026rsquo;ll need to add two lines of code to get the name and salutation from the process context.\nname := context.GetInput(\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;).(string) salutation := context.GetInput(\u0026quot;salutation\u0026quot;).(string)  The next step is to log it to the console\nlog.Infof(\u0026quot;The Flogo engine says [%s] to [%s]\u0026quot;, salutation, name)  And finally set the output\ncontext.SetOutput(\u0026quot;result\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;The Flogo engine says \u0026quot;+salutation+\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;+name)  All together your activity.go file should look something like the one below:\npackage HelloWorld import ( \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/core/activity\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/logger\u0026quot; ) // THIS IS ADDED // log is the default package logger which we'll use to log var log = logger.GetLogger(\u0026quot;activity-helloworld\u0026quot;) // MyActivity is a stub for your Activity implementation type MyActivity struct { metadata *activity.Metadata } // NewActivity creates a new activity func NewActivity(metadata *activity.Metadata) activity.Activity { return \u0026amp;MyActivity{metadata: metadata} } // Metadata implements activity.Activity.Metadata func (a *MyActivity) Metadata() *activity.Metadata { return a.metadata } // THIS HAS CHANGED // Eval implements activity.Activity.Eval func (a *MyActivity) Eval(context activity.Context) (done bool, err error) { // Get the activity data from the context name := context.GetInput(\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;).(string) salutation := context.GetInput(\u0026quot;salutation\u0026quot;).(string) // Use the log object to log the greeting log.Infof(\u0026quot;The Flogo engine says [%s] to [%s]\u0026quot;, salutation, name) // Set the result as part of the context context.SetOutput(\u0026quot;result\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;The Flogo engine says \u0026quot;+salutation+\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;+name) // Signal to the Flogo engine that the activity is completed return true, nil }  To make sure that you can test and build the new activity, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to go get (pun intended) a few packages\ngo get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/core/activity go get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/logger  Unit testing You\u0026rsquo;ve just completed the logic of the activity and, following best practice, you should have an automated way to test the activity to make sure that the it works and so that other developers can run the same tests to validate the output as well. The functions getActivityMetadata and TestCreate are default methods and the TestEval is the one you\u0026rsquo;ll need to update. You\u0026rsquo;ll want to compare the output with the expected output so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to add a new import\n\u0026quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\u0026quot;  Since the engine will still expect inputs, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to hard code them into the method and execute the eval method of the activity\n//setup attrs tc.SetInput(\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Flogo Dev\u0026quot;) tc.SetInput(\u0026quot;salutation\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot;) act.Eval(tc)  To make sure that the fields are properly concatenated, you need to validate the output too:\n//check result attr result := tc.GetOutput(\u0026quot;result\u0026quot;) assert.Equal(t, result, \u0026quot;The Flogo engine says Hello to Flogo Dev\u0026quot;)  The updated file will look something like the one below:\npackage HelloWorld import ( \u0026quot;io/ioutil\u0026quot; \u0026quot;testing\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/action/flow/test\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/core/activity\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\u0026quot; ) var activityMetadata *activity.Metadata func getActivityMetadata() *activity.Metadata { if activityMetadata == nil { jsonMetadataBytes, err := ioutil.ReadFile(\u0026quot;activity.json\u0026quot;) if err != nil { panic(\u0026quot;No Json Metadata found for activity.json path\u0026quot;) } activityMetadata = activity.NewMetadata(string(jsonMetadataBytes)) } return activityMetadata } func TestCreate(t *testing.T) { act := NewActivity(getActivityMetadata()) if act == nil { t.Error(\u0026quot;Activity Not Created\u0026quot;) t.Fail() return } } func TestEval(t *testing.T) { defer func() { if r := recover(); r != nil { t.Failed() t.Errorf(\u0026quot;panic during execution: %v\u0026quot;, r) } }() act := NewActivity(getActivityMetadata()) tc := test.NewTestActivityContext(getActivityMetadata()) //setup attrs tc.SetInput(\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Leon\u0026quot;) tc.SetInput(\u0026quot;salutation\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot;) act.Eval(tc) //check result attr result := tc.GetOutput(\u0026quot;result\u0026quot;) assert.Equal(t, result, \u0026quot;The Flogo engine says Hello to Flogo Dev\u0026quot;) }  In order to run the test cases you\u0026rsquo;ll need to intall two more packages. One to be able to tun the tests and one to be able to create assertions.\ngo get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/action/flow/test go get github.com/stretchr/testify/assert  To run all the test cases for your activity, in this case just one, simply enter\ngo test  and if all goes well the result should look like\nPASS ok _/C_/tools/gosrc/HelloWorld 0.051s  Use your new activity in a flow Now the only thing left to do is use the activity inside a Flogo app! You have two options, install the new activity using the Flogo CLI or via the Web UI. In any case you\u0026rsquo;ll first want to publish your activity to a Git repo (the same one you\u0026rsquo;ve used in the ref field in the activity.json). To add the new activity to a Flogo engine and use it in a flow you can import it using the following flogo CLI command, from your flow app directory):\nflogo install github.com/yourusername/yourrepository  or import it using the \u0026ldquo;Install new activity\u0026rdquo; option in the Flogo Web UI, where you\u0026rsquo;ll need to provide the URL https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.\n"

The elements in the file are:\n name: The name of the activity (this should match the name of the folder the activity is in, like MyTimerTrigger) version: The version of the activity (it is recommended to use semantic versioning for your trigger) type: This describes to the Flogo engine what kind of contribution this is (this should be trigger in this case) ref: The Flogo engine is based on Go and this field is the \u0026ldquo;import\u0026rdquo; path for Go apps (generally speaking this should match your repository) description: A brief description of your activity (this is displayed in the Flogo Web UI) author: This is you! settings: An array of name/type pairs that describe global settings of the trigger (configuration that will be the same for every instance of this trigger used in your app) output: An array of name/type pairs that describe the output of the trigger (the data that gets sent to your flow) handler: An array of name/type pairs that describe flow specific settings of the trigger (configuration that will be unique for every instance of this trigger used in your app)  Since you\u0026rsquo;ll want to provide some configuration, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to update the outputs section\n The settings section will be left empty (you\u0026rsquo;ll use flow specific settings) The output section needs a parameter called output (should be of type string) The handler/settings section needs a parameter called seconds (should be of type string)  Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to update the author, ref, and description fields, as well!\n The updated trigger.json will look quite similar to the below one.\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;MyTimerTrigger\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0.0.1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;flogo:trigger\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;This is a new Timer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/yourusername/yourrepository\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;author\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Flogo Dev\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;:[ ], \u0026quot;output\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;output\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string\u0026quot; } ], \u0026quot;handler\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;seconds\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string\u0026quot; } ] } }  The logic For the Flogo engine to actually do something we need to update the *.go files. There are two files in your current directory:\n trigger.go: which contains the actual trigger implementation in go trigger_test.go: which contains unit tests for the trigger  The first step is to look at the business logic, in the trigger.go file.\nTo begin there are a few packages you\u0026rsquo;ll need to import to make sure the code will work:\n\u0026quot;context\u0026quot; \u0026quot;strconv\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/core/trigger\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/logger\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/carlescere/scheduler\u0026quot;  As you want to log output to the console you\u0026rsquo;ll need to add a new variable called log to the main part of the file\n// Create a new logger var log = logger.GetLogger(\u0026quot;trigger-mytrigger\u0026quot;)  The struct called MyTrigger needs a few more fields to keep track of all the different elements it needs to know about. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to add the timers and handlers so that the engine knows which timers exist and which flows to call when a timer runs.\n// MyTrigger is a stub for your Trigger implementation type MyTrigger struct { metadata *trigger.Metadata config *trigger.Config timers []*scheduler.Job handlers []*trigger.Handler }  In the Initialize method you\u0026rsquo;ll need to add one statement to make sure that the trigger can get all the handlers it should know about from the context object.\nt.handlers = ctx.GetHandlers()  The Start method implements the logic required to start the various timers you might create in your app and for each it will schedule a job (using the scheduleRepeating method)\n// Start implements trigger.Trigger.Start func (t *MyTrigger) Start() error { log.Debug(\u0026quot;Start\u0026quot;) handlers := t.handlers log.Debug(\u0026quot;Processing handlers\u0026quot;) for _, handler := range handlers { t.scheduleRepeating(handler) } return nil }  The scheduleRepeating method is used to schedule a repeating job with a specified time interval. The variable called fn2 is executed when a timer fires and calls the flow it should trigger with the data specified in the map triggerData. The map contains a field called output which matches the name in the trigger.json file.\nfunc (t *MyTrigger) scheduleRepeating(endpoint *trigger.Handler) { log.Info(\u0026quot;Scheduling a repeating job\u0026quot;) fn2 := func() { // Create a map to hold the trigger data triggerData := map[string]interface{}{ \u0026quot;output\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Hello World from the new Timer Trigger\u0026quot;, } _, err := endpoint.Handle(context.Background(), triggerData) if err != nil { log.Error(\u0026quot;Error running handler: \u0026quot;, err.Error()) } } t.scheduleJobEverySecond(endpoint, fn2) }  Finally, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to add a method called scheduleJobEverySecond to make sure the engine checks the timers on a regular basis and executes the function to trigger a flow.\nfunc (t *MyTrigger) scheduleJobEverySecond(tgrHandler *trigger.Handler, fn func()) { var interval int seconds, _ := strconv.Atoi(tgrHandler.GetStringSetting(\u0026quot;seconds\u0026quot;)) interval = interval + seconds log.Debug(\u0026quot;Repeating seconds: \u0026quot;, interval) // schedule repeating timerJob, err := scheduler.Every(interval).Seconds().Run(fn) if err != nil { log.Error(\u0026quot;Error scheduleRepeating (repeat seconds) flo err: \u0026quot;, err.Error()) } if timerJob == nil { log.Error(\u0026quot;timerJob is nil\u0026quot;) } t.timers = append(t.timers, timerJob) }  The completed file will look something like:\npackage MyTimerTrigger import ( \u0026quot;context\u0026quot; \u0026quot;strconv\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/core/trigger\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/logger\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/carlescere/scheduler\u0026quot; ) // Create a new logger var log = logger.GetLogger(\u0026quot;trigger-mytrigger\u0026quot;) // MyTriggerFactory My Trigger factory type MyTriggerFactory struct { metadata *trigger.Metadata } // NewFactory create a new Trigger factory func NewFactory(md *trigger.Metadata) trigger.Factory { return \u0026amp;MyTriggerFactory{metadata: md} } // New Creates a new trigger instance for a given id func (t *MyTriggerFactory) New(config *trigger.Config) trigger.Trigger { return \u0026amp;MyTrigger{metadata: t.metadata, config: config} } // MyTrigger is a stub for your Trigger implementation type MyTrigger struct { metadata *trigger.Metadata config *trigger.Config timers []*scheduler.Job handlers []*trigger.Handler } // Initialize implements trigger.Init.Initialize func (t *MyTrigger) Initialize(ctx trigger.InitContext) error { t.handlers = ctx.GetHandlers() return nil } // Metadata implements trigger.Trigger.Metadata func (t *MyTrigger) Metadata() *trigger.Metadata { return t.metadata } // Start implements trigger.Trigger.Start func (t *MyTrigger) Start() error { log.Debug(\u0026quot;Start\u0026quot;) handlers := t.handlers log.Debug(\u0026quot;Processing handlers\u0026quot;) for _, handler := range handlers { t.scheduleRepeating(handler) } return nil } // Stop implements trigger.Trigger.Start func (t *MyTrigger) Stop() error { // stop the trigger return nil } func (t *MyTrigger) scheduleRepeating(endpoint *trigger.Handler) { log.Info(\u0026quot;Scheduling a repeating job\u0026quot;) fn2 := func() { // Create a map to hold the trigger data triggerData := map[string]interface{}{ \u0026quot;output\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Hello World from the new Timer Trigger\u0026quot;, } _, err := endpoint.Handle(context.Background(), triggerData) if err != nil { log.Error(\u0026quot;Error running handler: \u0026quot;, err.Error()) } } t.scheduleJobEverySecond(endpoint, fn2) } func (t *MyTrigger) scheduleJobEverySecond(tgrHandler *trigger.Handler, fn func()) { var interval int seconds, _ := strconv.Atoi(tgrHandler.GetStringSetting(\u0026quot;seconds\u0026quot;)) interval = interval + seconds log.Debug(\u0026quot;Repeating seconds: \u0026quot;, interval) // schedule repeating timerJob, err := scheduler.Every(interval).Seconds().Run(fn) if err != nil { log.Error(\u0026quot;Error scheduleRepeating (repeat seconds) flo err: \u0026quot;, err.Error()) } if timerJob == nil { log.Error(\u0026quot;timerJob is nil\u0026quot;) } t.timers = append(t.timers, timerJob) }  To make sure that you can test and build the new trigger, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to go get (pun intended) a few packages\ngo get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/core/trigger go get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/logger go get github.com/carlescere/scheduler  Use your new trigger in a flow Now the only thing left to do is use the trigger inside a Flogo app! You have two options, install the new trigger using the Flogo CLI or via the Web UI. In any case you\u0026rsquo;ll first want to publish your trigger to a Git repo (the same one you\u0026rsquo;ve used in the ref field in the trigger.json). To add the new trigger to a Flogo engine and use it in a flow you can import it using the following flogo CLI command, from your flow app directory):\nflogo install github.com/yourusername/yourrepository  or import it using the \u0026ldquo;Install new trigger\u0026rdquo; option in the Flogo Web UI, where you\u0026rsquo;ll need to provide the URL https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.\n"

	"content": " Project Flogo offers multiple ways to build apps:\n Web UI: You can develop flows using a zero code Web UI, which allows you to graphically build your microservices; JSON DSL: You can also build an app using a sophisticated, but elegant, JSON DSL (the Web UI uses this internally as well!); Go API: You can use the Go API to use Flogo as a Librry in your Go app!  In this tutorial you will learn how to use Flogo as a Library and to build a Go app while leveraging the Flogo engine. The tutorial makes use of the REST trigger as well as the Log activity.\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need Go This demo makes use of Go. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t installed Go yet, check out how to install it here. You\u0026rsquo;ll need Go 1.9.x or higher for this tutorial.\nNeed help If you have any questions, feel free to post an issue on GitHub and tag it as a question or chat with the team and community:\n The project-flogo/Lobby Start here for all things Flogo! The project-flogo/developers Developer/contributor focused conversations.  Step 1: Outline The service you\u0026rsquo;ll build needs a file in which to code. The steps will walk you through the creation of the file and walk through the entire source code, to make sure you add all the right things you need for the cheesecake servuce. To get started, create a file called main.go, which will be the main file of the cheesecake service.\ntouch main.go  A Go app that uses Flogo as a Library isn\u0026rsquo;t any different from a regular Go app, with one subtle addition right at the beginning of the file. Since the Flogo engine requires metadata of each activity you\u0026rsquo;ll need to make sure that the Go compiler creates, and packages, that metadata as well. To do so, add the below line as the first line in your file\n//go:generate go run $GOPATH/src/github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/flogo/gen/gen.go $GOPATH  This line will tell go what to do when running the generate command. The generate command runs commands described by directives within existing files. Those commands can run any process but the intent is to create or update Go source files and in this case it generates the metadata files for your service.\nStep 2: Imports To make the app work, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a few imports\npackage main import ( // Default Go packages \u0026quot;context\u0026quot; \u0026quot;os\u0026quot; \u0026quot;strconv\u0026quot; // The Flogo Log activity \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log\u0026quot; // The Flogo REST trigger \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/trigger/rest\u0026quot; // Core packages for the Flogo engine \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/core/data\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/engine\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/flogo\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/logger\u0026quot; )  Just like with any Go package, the Go compiler needs to have access to them to be able to compile the program into an executable. To make sure the packages are available, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to run\ngo get -u github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log go get -u github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/trigger/rest go get -u github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/core/data go get -u github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/engine go get -u github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/flogo go get -u github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/logger  Step 3: Variables Hard coding variables is never a good idea. As you\u0026rsquo;re building an app that uses the HTTP trigger, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to make sure that the HTTP port is configurable. To do so add the below directive to your main.go file\nvar ( httpport = os.Getenv(\u0026quot;HTTPPORT\u0026quot;) )  The app will now be able to use an environment variable called HTTPPORT as the port for the HTTP trigger\nStep 4: Main Every app needs a main function as the entry point into the program, and a Flogo app isn\u0026rsquo;t any different. The main function in the case of a Go app that uses Flogo as a Library, might look a little different:\nfunc main() { // Create a new Flogo app app := appBuilder() e, err := flogo.NewEngine(app) if err != nil { logger.Error(err) return } engine.RunEngine(e) }  The first line creates the app (using a method you\u0026rsquo;ll define in the next step). The lines after that create the Flogo engine and instruct the engine to run the app.\nStep 5: The app The Flogo engine needs an app to run, and to construct that app you\u0026rsquo;ll need another method\nfunc appBuilder() *flogo.App { app := flogo.NewApp() // Convert the HTTPPort to an integer port, err := strconv.Atoi(httpport) if err != nil { logger.Error(err) } // Register the HTTP trigger trg := app.NewTrigger(\u0026amp;rest.RestTrigger{}, map[string]interface{}{\u0026quot;port\u0026quot;: port}) trg.NewFuncHandler(map[string]interface{}{\u0026quot;method\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;GET\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/cheesecake/:name\u0026quot;}, Handler) return app }  The first line constructs the app, that will be returned as the result of this method. The next step is to convert the HTTPPORT variable from a string into an integer. The last part, before the return, is creating the HTTP trigger. In this section you create a new trigger using a method call with two parameters:\n The trigger type: \u0026amp;rest.RestTrigger{} The settings: map[string]interface{}{\u0026quot;port\u0026quot;: port} (if you check the trigger.json, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the port field is a global setting)  After that, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to register a function handler for each of the HTTP methods and PATHs you want to handle. In this case the app will handle a GET operation for the path /cheesecake/:name (where :name is a PATH parameter) and as events come in for this path, it will dispatch them to a method called Handler.\nStep 6: The Handler The next step is that your app needs to handle the events and to do so, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create a method called Handler:\n// Handler is the function that gets executed when the engine receives a message func Handler(ctx context.Context, inputs map[string]*data.Attribute) (map[string]*data.Attribute, error) { // Get the name from the path name := inputs[\u0026quot;pathParams\u0026quot;].Value().(map[string]string)[\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;] // Log, using the Flogo log activity // There are definitely better ways to do this with Go, but we want to show how to use activities in := map[string]interface{}{\u0026quot;message\u0026quot;: name, \u0026quot;flowInfo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;true\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;addToFlow\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;true\u0026quot;} _, err := flogo.EvalActivity(\u0026amp;log.LogActivity{}, in) if err != nil { return nil, err } // Set the result message var cheesecake string switch name { case \u0026quot;retgits\u0026quot;: cheesecake = \u0026quot;Likes all cheesecakes\u0026quot; case \u0026quot;flynn\u0026quot;: cheesecake = \u0026quot;Prefers some nectar!\u0026quot; default: cheesecake = \u0026quot;Plain cheesecake is the best\u0026quot; } // The return message is a map[string]*data.Attribute which we'll have to construct response := make(map[string]interface{}) response[\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;] = name response[\u0026quot;cheesecake\u0026quot;] = cheesecake ret := make(map[string]*data.Attribute) ret[\u0026quot;code\u0026quot;], _ = data.NewAttribute(\u0026quot;code\u0026quot;, data.TypeInteger, 200) ret[\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;], _ = data.NewAttribute(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, data.TypeAny, response) return ret, nil }  From top to bottom the code does the following:\n1) Get the name from the PATH parameter; 2) Execute the log activity (the inputs passed in as a map[string]interface{} are the same fields as in the activity.json); 3) Use a regular Go switch statement to determine the favorite cheesecake based on the name; 4) Create a map[string]interface{} with the return values of the app; 5) Return an HTTP statuscode and the message.\nStep 7: Complete app Right now, your complete app should look like\n//go:generate go run $GOPATH/src/github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/flogo/gen/gen.go $GOPATH package main import ( // Default Go packages \u0026quot;context\u0026quot; \u0026quot;os\u0026quot; \u0026quot;strconv\u0026quot; // The Flogo Log activity \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log\u0026quot; // The Flogo REST trigger \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/trigger/rest\u0026quot;

\u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/logger\u0026quot; ) var ( httpport = os.Getenv(\u0026quot;HTTPPORT\u0026quot;) ) func main() { // Create a new Flogo app app := appBuilder() e, err := flogo.NewEngine(app) if err != nil { logger.Error(err) return } engine.RunEngine(e) } func appBuilder() *flogo.App { app := flogo.NewApp() // Convert the HTTPPort to an integer port, err := strconv.Atoi(httpport) if err != nil { logger.Error(err) } // Register the HTTP trigger trg := app.NewTrigger(\u0026amp;rest.RestTrigger{}, map[string]interface{}{\u0026quot;port\u0026quot;: port}) trg.NewFuncHandler(map[string]interface{}{\u0026quot;method\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;GET\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/cheesecake/:name\u0026quot;}, Handler) return app } // Handler is the function that gets executed when the engine receives a message func Handler(ctx context.Context, inputs map[string]*data.Attribute) (map[string]*data.Attribute, error) { // Get the name from the path name := inputs[\u0026quot;pathParams\u0026quot;].Value().(map[string]string)[\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;] // Log, using the Flogo log activity // There are definitely better ways to do this with Go, but we want to show how to use activities in := map[string]interface{}{\u0026quot;message\u0026quot;: name, \u0026quot;flowInfo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;true\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;addToFlow\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;true\u0026quot;} _, err := flogo.EvalActivity(\u0026amp;log.LogActivity{}, in) if err != nil { return nil, err } // Set the result message var cheesecake string switch name { case \u0026quot;retgits\u0026quot;: cheesecake = \u0026quot;Likes all cheesecakes\u0026quot; case \u0026quot;flynn\u0026quot;: cheesecake = \u0026quot;Prefers some nectar!\u0026quot; default: cheesecake = \u0026quot;Plain cheesecake is the best\u0026quot; } // The return message is a map[string]*data.Attribute which we'll have to construct response := make(map[string]interface{}) response[\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;] = name response[\u0026quot;cheesecake\u0026quot;] = cheesecake ret := make(map[string]*data.Attribute) ret[\u0026quot;code\u0026quot;], _ = data.NewAttribute(\u0026quot;code\u0026quot;, data.TypeInteger, 200) ret[\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;], _ = data.NewAttribute(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, data.TypeAny, response) return ret, nil }  Step 7: Build To build the app, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to run two commands:\n// Make sure that the metadata is generated go generate // Build the app go build -o cheesecakesvc  Because you\u0026rsquo;re using Flogo as a Library in your app, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to use the flogo build command but instead use the regular go build with any parameters you might want to pass in (-o cheesecakesvc means the output will be an executable called cheesecakesvc).\nStep 8: Run To run the app simply run\nHTTPPORT=8888 ./cheesecakesvc  And in a separate terminal run to see the result of your app\n$ curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8888/cheesecake/retgits {\u0026quot;cheesecake\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Likes all cheesecakes\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;retgits\u0026quot;}  "

If you don\u0026rsquo;t have that one running yet, please check out Getting Started with the Flogo CLI\nUsing flogo Out of the box, Flogo has the option to build a docker container from the app.\nflogo build -e -docker \u0026lt;trigger id\u0026gt;  The above command will build a Flogo app, with embedded configuration (-e), and create a docker image where it can expose the PORT based on which trigger ID you specify. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to expose a port (for example, because you start with a timer) you can specify no-trigger as the trigger id.\nThe docker file it generates and uses to build the docker image is:\n# Dockerfile for {{.name}} # VERSION {{.version}} FROM alpine RUN apk update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apk add ca-certificates ADD {{.name}}-linux-amd64 . EXPOSE {{.port}} CMD ./{{.name}}-linux-amd64`  note that {{.name}} and {{.port}} are substitution variables coming from the configuration of your app\n After building the image you can run the container using the docker run command\nDo-It-Yourself While practical, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to rely on flogo to generate the docker image for you. If you prefer to construct the Dockerfile yourself, that is perfectly okay too. The flogo cli simply wraps the command:\ndocker build . -t \u0026lt;app name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;app version\u0026gt;  "

	"content": " Depending on where you store the source code and how publicly you want to have the code available you have a few options to continuously testing Flogo activities. In this tutorial you\u0026rsquo;ll look at Jenkins when using a local git server and Travis-CI for activities on GitHub\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need Flogo CLI This demo makes use of the Flogo CLI. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have that one running yet, please check out Getting Started with the Flogo CLI\nJenkins \u0026amp; Travis-CI You\u0026rsquo;ll need to have Jenkins set up, together with the Go plugin (Go version 1.10 or higher) and you\u0026rsquo;ll need an account to Travis-CI. An account for the latter is free, if you want to use it with Open Source repositories.\nNeed help If you have any questions, feel free to post an issue on GitHub and tag it as a question or chat with the team and community:\n The project-flogo/Lobby Start here for all things Flogo! The project-flogo/developers Developer/contributor focused conversations.  Structure The project structure we\u0026rsquo;ll use has separate folders for activities and triggers. A sample layout would look like this:\n├───\u0026lt;Repo root\u0026gt; │ └───activity | | └───\u0026lt;my-activity\u0026gt; | | |───\u0026lt;all my files\u0026gt; │ └───trigger | └───\u0026lt;my-trigger\u0026gt; | |───\u0026lt;all my files\u0026gt;  For example, the Flogo Contrib repository looks like:\n├─── flogo-contrib │ └───a ctivity | └─── log | |─── README.md | |─── activity.go | |─── activity.json | |─── activity_test.go  Jenkins Installing the Go Plugin To get started with Go in Jenkins there is a great plugin that makes it all very easy. To install the Go Plugin for Jenkins go to Manage Jenkins -\u0026gt; Manage Plugins and search for Go Plugin on the Available tab. After that select Download now and install after restart to restart Jenkins.\nAfter you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, it is time to select the version of Go you want to use for the builds. Go to Manage Jenkins -\u0026gt; Global Tool Configuration and look for the Go section. Click on the button Go installations\u0026hellip; and specify a name for your installation. The name itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any significance, but it will make it a lot easier to find the right one later on. Check the box for Install automatically and select the version you want to have installed. After that click Apply follows by Save.\nConfiguring the build job Within Jenkins create a New Item and select a Freestyle project. Since repositories can have multiple activities, you can select a parameterized project.\nIn the Build Environment section you need to check two boxes:\n Delete workspace before build starts: This makes sure you always start with fresh code and nothing lingers around; Set up Go programming language tools: This was added by the Go Plugin and lets you pick the Go version you configured earlier (this is where the name comes in).  In the Build section add a new build step that executes a shell command. The shell command will take care of getting the dependencies and executing the test cases:\n## Go get the Project Flogo dependencies go get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/... go get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/... ## Go get the test dependencies go get github.com/stretchr/testify/assert ## Find all the activities and run the test cases for them for path in ./activity/*; do [ -d \u0026quot;${path}\u0026quot; ] || continue # if not a directory, skip dirname=\u0026quot;$(basename \u0026quot;${path}\u0026quot;)\u0026quot; ## Run the test cases go test ./activity/$dirname done  Travis-CI For code that exists on GitHub there are a lot of options (including Jenkins), but let\u0026rsquo;s look at Travis-CI. Travis-CI is continuous integration for projects hosted on GitHub and provides automation for testing building and deploying. They have quite a good Getting Started guide, so this tutorial skips that part of the setup and dives right into it.\nAs you push your code to GitHub, the only additional file you need for Travis-CI to work is a file called .travis.yml (and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to turn on the builds from the Travis Web UI).\n## We don't need elevated privileges sudo: false ## The language should be Go and we'll use version 1.8.3 language: go go: - 1.10 ## The below statement skips all branches that start with a 'v' (e.g. v1) so that we can have working branches that get committed. branches: except: - /^v.*/ ## Install the dependencies we need install: - go get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/... - go get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/... - go get github.com/stretchr/testify/assert ## The script is the same as it was in Jenkins, though joined to be a single line script: - for path in ./activity/*; do [ -d \u0026quot;${path}\u0026quot; ] || continue; dirname=\u0026quot;$(basename \u0026quot;${path}\u0026quot;)\u0026quot;; go test ./activity/$dirname; done; zip -r release.zip ./activity/ ./connector/  "

With SAM CLI, you can easily author automated integration tests by first running tests against local Lambda functions before deploying to the cloud.\n Now that is awesome! In order to make that work, SAM needs to have a descriptor called template.yml that describes what the function is and what other parameters it has. Assuming you\u0026rsquo;ve used the app above, a YAML file could look like\nAWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09' Transform: 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31' Description: Serverless Application Model Resources: flogoapp: # The name you want to give your Lambda function Type: 'AWS::Serverless::Function' Properties: CodeUri: bin/ # The location where to find the executable file (not the zip file from the Web UI) Handler: handler # The name of the handler generated by the flogo build command Runtime: go1.x Tracing: Active Timeout: 120 Events: flogoevent: # This is a sample event Type: Schedule Properties: Schedule: cron(0 2 * * ? *) # Run at 2:00 am (UTC) every day Description: Run Hello World every night! # A description for your Lambda app MemorySize: 128 # The amount of memory you want to give your app in Lambda  For clarity sake, you can create a new directory called lambda and put all files in that directory.\nStep 3: Events To be able to test the apps locally, SAM makes use of events from JSON files. Events describe the input that would normally come from external apps like Amazon S3 or Amazon API Gateway. In this case, the event will be really simple. You\u0026rsquo;ll have to create a new file called event.json and the content of the file will be:\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;World\u0026quot; }  Step 4: Run locally Before you can run the app, the final step is to copy the executable file (generated in step 1) to the right location. Create a bin folder in the lambda folder you created earlier and copy the file /src/myapp/handler to that location.\nFrom a terminal window you can now use the SAM CLI to run your app locally:\nsam local invoke \u0026lt;function\u0026gt; -e \u0026lt;event.json file\u0026gt;  So in this case the command will be\nsam local invoke flogoapp -e event.json  As you run that, the output will look like (the last line will display the result of your app)\n2018-10-03 16:53:03 Invoking handler (go1.x) 2018-10-03 16:53:03 Found credentials in shared credentials file: ~/.aws/credentials Fetching lambci/lambda:go1.x Docker container image...... 2018-10-03 16:53:04 Mounting /Users/lstigter/Downloads/myapp/lambda/bin as /var/task:ro inside runtime container START RequestId: 8791ddd9-c612-1864-f381-75d1506ad692 Version: $LATEST 2018-10-03 23:53:05.119 INFO [trigger-flogo-lambda] - Starting AWS Lambda Trigger 2018/10/03 23:53:05 Starting AWS Lambda Trigger 2018/10/03 23:53:05 Received evt: 'map[name:World]' 2018/10/03 23:53:05 Received ctx: 'map[awsRequestId:8791ddd9-c612-1864-f381-75d1506ad692 functionName:test functionVersion:$LATEST logGroupName:/aws/lambda/test logStreamName:2018/10/03/[$LATEST]b1ff97369e34dbbe4f8ee4f578cde273 memoryLimitInMB:128]' 2018-10-03 23:53:05.123 INFO [activity-flogo-log] - Hello World END RequestId: 8791ddd9-c612-1864-f381-75d1506ad692 REPORT RequestId: 8791ddd9-c612-1864-f381-75d1506ad692\tDuration: 5.38 ms\tBilled Duration: 100 ms\tMemory Size: 128 MB\tMax Memory Used: 8 MB {\u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;World\u0026quot;}  "

	"content": " Let\u0026rsquo;s build an invoiceservice! In this tutorial we\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through building an app with several community-driven activities and talks to other services as well. The lab also covers Input/Output mappings, Invoking a REST service and Complex object mapping.\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need The Flogo Web UI This demo makes use of the Flogo Web UI. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have that one running yet, please check out Getting Started with the Flogo Web UI\nApps This demo builds one of the services of the Kubernetes tutorial. After building this app, you might want to try and deploy it to Kubernetes too! The app will use the Payment Service to get some data, so you\u0026rsquo;ll likely want to start with that one if you haven\u0026rsquo;t built it yet.\nNeed help If you have any questions, feel free to post an issue on GitHub and tag it as a question or chat with the team and community:\n The project-flogo/Lobby Start here for all things Flogo! The project-flogo/developers Developer/contributor focused conversations.  Step 1: Create the app Open the Flogo Web UI and from there, click \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; to create a new microservice and give your new app a name. Click \u0026ldquo;Create a Flow\u0026rdquo; to create a new flow and give it any name that you want. Now click on the flow you just created and to open the canvas where you can design your flow.\nStep 2: Add a trigger Triggers are used to signal a flow to run. In this case you want to receive an HTTP message to get invoice information. To add a trigger, click on the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; icon on the left hand side of the screen and select the Receive HTTP Message trigger.\nThe invoice ID for which you want the information comes from the HTTP request. To get that parameter into the flow, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create an Input parameter which you can do by clicking on the grey \u0026ldquo;Input Output\u0026rdquo; bar on your screen. For example, you can call the parameter \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo;, keep the type as \u0026ldquo;string\u0026rdquo; and click save.\nThe response to the HTTP request will be a message and the HTTP status code, and to be able to send data back you\u0026rsquo;ll need to have Output parameters. You can create them by clicking on the grey \u0026ldquo;Input Output\u0026rdquo; bar on your screen. From there, select Output and configure two parameters:\n Parameter name: code Type: integer  Now click on the + sign to add a new parameter\n Parameter name: response Type: any  Now it is time to configure the trigger to listen to HTTP messages. To start, click on the trigger and a new dialog will open with a bunch of options. In this dialog you\u0026rsquo;ll have to provide:\n Port: The port on which your app will listen (set this to 9234) Method: The HTTP method that will trigger this flow (set this to GET) Path: The path that will route the messages to this flow (set this to /api/invoices/:id, the :id means that you can use that as a path parameter in your mappings)  After that, click on \u0026ldquo;Map to flow inputs\u0026rdquo; to map the invoiceId from the HTTP trigger to the \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; parameter we created earlier. The parameter will already be selected because it is the only one. Since the data will come from the PATH parameters, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to type $.pathParams.id in the input box, which means the Flogo app will expect a PATH parameter called invoiceId to be present.\nWith the inputs taken care off, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the outputs. Click on \u0026ldquo;Map to flow outputs\u0026rdquo; to map the output parameters you created earlier to the response of the trigger. The code parameter will already be selected, so click on \u0026ldquo;123 code\u0026rdquo; in the Flow Output section to create the mapping. Now click on \u0026ldquo;response\u0026rdquo; in the Trigger Response section and select \u0026ldquo;* data\u0026rdquo; from the Flow Output section to create the mapping. Click \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo; to make sure everything is, well…, saved. You can click the little X on the top-right (no, not your browser…) to close the dialog window and go back to the flow.\nThe URL on which our microservice will listen will be http://localhost:9234/api/invoices/:id (the :invoiceId is a parameter that you can replace with anything during runtime). If you made changes to any of the variables above, please make sure to change those in the rest of these examples.\n Step 3: Add activities You’ll have to add some acvitivities to the flow for it to do something. To add an activity click on the large + sign\nA list with all the activities the Flogo Web UI knows about will appear. From the list you can pick the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity (or use the searchbar to find it) and click it to make sure it is added to the flow. As you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In this window you can configure the inputs of the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity. Click on \u0026ldquo;a.. message\u0026rdquo; and type string.concat(\u0026quot;Get Invoice request received for: \u0026quot;, $flow.id) in the box (on the right hand side of the screen). This will, when you run the app, concatenate a string and the id.\nIn the same way, add a new activity. The activity that is needed, to generate a random number, isn\u0026rsquo;t part of the out-of-the-box activities so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to import it.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Install new activity\u0026rdquo; and a dialog appears where you can paste (or type) the URL of where the Flogo Web UI can get the sources. For this activity you can use https://github.com/retgits/flogo-components/activity/randomnumber. From the updated list you can pick the \u0026ldquo;Random number\u0026rdquo; activity (or use the searchbar to find it) and click it to make sure it is added to the flow. As you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In this window you can configure the inputs of the \u0026ldquo;Random number\u0026rdquo; activity.\n max: 2000 (the maximum value the random number will have) min: 1000 (the minimum value the random number will have)  In the same way, add a new activity and this time install the \u0026ldquo;Combine\u0026rdquo; activity to concatenate multiple values. The URL you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use to install the activity is https://github.com/jvanderl/flogo-components/activity/combine.\n delimeter: \u0026quot;-\u0026quot; (the delimeter used to separate the strings) part1: \u0026quot;INV\u0026quot; (a hardcoded string) part2: $flow.id (the id that was passed in as a PATH parameter)  Add another \u0026ldquo;Random number\u0026rdquo; activity to the flow, in the same way you\u0026rsquo;ve done before. This time you won\u0026rsquo;t need to install it, because the Flogo Web UI already knows about it. As you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In this window you can configure the inputs of the \u0026ldquo;Random number\u0026rdquo; activity.\n max: 1000 (the maximum value the random number will have) min: 0 (the minimum value the random number will have)  The next step is to add a \u0026ldquo;Invoke REST Service\u0026rdquo; activity, which will call the Payment Service to get some data. You can add the activity in the same way you\u0026rsquo;ve done before. As you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In this window you can configure the inputs:\n content: \u0026lt;empty\u0026gt; (the content you want to send to the REST service, in this case the service doesn\u0026rsquo;t need any so you can keep this field empty) header: \u0026lt;empty\u0026gt; (any header parameters you want to send to the REST service, in this case the service doesn\u0026rsquo;t need any so you can keep this field empty) method: \u0026quot;GET\u0026quot; (the HTTP method to call the other service) pathParams: {\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;{{$flow.id}}\u0026quot;} (this will add a PATH parameter with the value of the id that was passed into this flow) proxy: \u0026lt;empty\u0026gt; (HTTP proxy settings you need to call the other service you can keep this field empty) queryParams: \u0026lt;empty\u0026gt; (any query parameters you want to send to the REST service, in this case the service doesn\u0026rsquo;t need any so you can keep this field empty) skipSsl: \u0026quot;false\u0026quot; (This setting indicates if, when HTTPS is used, the certificate check should be skipped or not) uri: http://localhost:9233/api/expected-date/:id (This is the URL, including any PATH parameters used, to call the other service. In this case the Payment Service)  Step 4: Return data To complete the flow, add a Return activity. Hover over it to see the cog and select configure to bring up the modal to configure the activity. The return activity is always the last activity in a branch and sets the values that are returned to the trigger. Click on \u0026ldquo;123 code\u0026rdquo; and type 200 in the input field to set the HTTP Response code to 200.\nNow click on \u0026ldquo;* message\u0026rdquo; and type (or copy) the structure below. Finally click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; to complete the mapping.\n{ \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;{{$flow.id}}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;{{$activity[combine_4].result}}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;amount\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;{{$activity[randomnumber_3].result}}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;balance\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;{{$activity[randomnumber_5].result}}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;expectedPaymentDate\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;{{$activity[rest_6].result.expectedDate}}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;currency\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;USD\u0026quot; }  The above snippet maps the values from the REST service to fields that are sent back to the trigger. The mapping is done in a JavaScript-like syntax, so $flow.id means it will get the id that was used as an input parameter to the flow (the one you configured earlier) and the $activity[xxx].result will get the result elements from the various activities. The double curly braces are used as by Go\u0026rsquo;s templating engine.\nYour final flow should look something like the one below.\nStep 5: Build Those were all the steps needed to design the flow, now let\u0026rsquo;s build an executable from it. On the main screen of your flow click on the \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;\u0026rdquo; button on the top-left hand side of the screen. That will bring you back to your microservice and from here you can select \u0026ldquo;Build\u0026rdquo;. Choose whichever operating system you\u0026rsquo;re running on to download the executable.\nStep 6: Run To see the results, start both apps and run curl --request GET --url http://localhost:9234/api/invoices/12345. That will give you a result like\n{\u0026quot;amount\u0026quot;:1456,\u0026quot;balance\u0026quot;:456,\u0026quot;currency\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;USD\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;expectedPaymentDate\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2018-02-28\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2345\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;INV-2345\u0026quot;}  "

To do that, execute touch flogo.json in a terminal (or open up a new file in your text editor), which will create a new empty file for you.

To build a flogo app from the source you can execute the command flogo build -e, which tells the flogo cli to build the app (and place it in a bin directory) and embed all configuration into a single executable\nStep 3: Running the app You have just built the Flogo app, so now you can test it. From the bin directory (cd bin) you can run ./myapp which will start the app. In the terminal you\u0026rsquo;ll see something like\n2018-05-12 04:34:56.434 INFO [engine] - Engine Starting... 2018-05-12 04:34:56.435 INFO [engine] - Starting Services... 2018-05-12 04:34:56.435 INFO [engine] - Started Services 2018-05-12 04:34:56.435 INFO [engine] - Starting Triggers... 2018-05-12 04:34:56.435 INFO [engine] - Trigger [ receive_http_message ]: Started 2018-05-12 04:34:56.435 INFO [engine] - Triggers Started 2018-05-12 04:34:56.435 INFO [engine] - Engine Started  To test it we\u0026rsquo;ll use the curl command line tool, which is installed on most Operating Systems. From a new terminal window execute the command curl http://localhost:9233/counter. It will send an HTTP request to the app on port 9233 (which was configured in the flogo.json file) and it will log the number of invocations.\nStep 4: Getting it to your device Once you are ready to test your application on your device, check out these specialized labs that talk about building Flogo apps specifically for that device.\n Raspberry Pi Intel Edison BeagleBone  "

	"content": " Kubernetes is probably the most wellknown container orchestration platform out there, with a ton of companies building and hosting their own specific version or making use of of one. In this demo you explore how to run Flogo apps on Kubernetes. The demo will walk you through deploying two apps:\n An invoice service which gets details on the invoice you specify in the URL A payment service which gets details on the expected payment date for the invoice (The invoice service will make use of the payment service to display all data)  What you\u0026rsquo;ll need The demo needs a working Kubernetes cluster. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t got one, setting one up using minikube is quite easy! You\u0026rsquo;ll also need to have the Flogo CLI installed. If that is not the case, you might want to install them first. Our Getting Started guide walks you through the installation of Go, the Flogo CLI and Go Dep.\nScripts A fully scripted version of this tutorial is available in the samples directory as well! There are two different scenarios to deploy, one makes use of apps built using the Flogo Web UI and the other makes use of apps with the same functionality but built using the Go API.\nThe apps built with the Flogo Web UI are:\n Invoice Service Payment Service  The apps built with the Go API are:\n Invoice Service - Go Payment Service - Go  The shell script will allow you to choose between them, in this walk through you\u0026rsquo;ll make use of the apps built with the Flogo Web UI. In the scenario you\u0026rsquo;ll find a bunch of code blocks from which you can copy the code directly to your terminal. Please note that these commands are for MacOS and Linux, but should work on most Windows based systems as well.\nGetting the artifacts The first step is to create a directory that will contain all the artifacts. For now we\u0026rsquo;ll call that one flogo-on-kubernetes\n# Set a root directory so that all commands start from the same directory ROOTDIR=`pwd` # Set a working directory for all the artifacts WORKDIR=flogo-on-kubernetes # Make sure the directory is cleanly created rm -rf $ROOTDIR/$WORKDIR mkdir -p $ROOTDIR/$WORKDIR  Getting the Flogo apps The demo will consist of two apps deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. We\u0026rsquo;ll use docker images that already exist, but we do want to provide you with all the code and artifacts to show the apps in the Flogo Web UI. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with downloading the apps\ncd $ROOTDIR/$WORKDIR curl -o invoiceservice.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retgits/flogo-components/master/apps/invoiceservice/invoiceservice.json curl -o paymentservice.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retgits/flogo-components/master/apps/paymentservice/paymentservice.json  For each of the apps we\u0026rsquo;ll need to run a command to create the app structure and download any dependencies\nflogo create -f invoiceservice.json invoiceservice flogo create -f paymentservice.json paymentservice  Creating executables Now, let\u0026rsquo;s build the executables for the first app. We\u0026rsquo;ll build two executables. One that will be able to run natively on your machine and one that will be a Linux executable to run in a docker container. So for the first app those commands are\ncd $ROOTDIR/$WORKDIR/invoiceservice env GOOS=linux flogo build -e flogo build -e  For the second app they are\ncd $ROOTDIR/$WORKDIR/paymentservice env GOOS=linux flogo build -e flogo build -e  Dockerize all the things Now on to Docker! We\u0026rsquo;ll create docker images based on Alpine Linux. We\u0026rsquo;ll put a Dockerfile in the bin/linux_amd64 folder and run the command\n# Set your Docker Hub username DOCKERHUBUSER=my-name # Go to the right directory cd $ROOTDIR/$WORKDIR/invoiceservice/bin/linux_amd64 # Get a Dockerfile curl -o Dockerfile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retgits/flogo-components/master/apps/invoiceservice/Dockerfile # Run the docker build command docker build -t $DOCKERHUBUSER/invoiceservice .  And we\u0026rsquo;ll do the same for the second service as well.\n# Go to the right directory cd $ROOTDIR/$WORKDIR/paymentservice/bin/linux_amd64 # Get a Dockerfile curl -o Dockerfile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retgits/flogo-components/master/apps/paymentservice/Dockerfile # Run the docker build command docker build -t $DOCKERHUBUSER/paymentservice .  Running your Docker images Right now you have two new docker images available in your registry, which you could use to test the whole scenario as well. If you want to do that run the below commands in separate terminal windows\ndocker run --rm -it -p 9998:8080 $DOCKERHUBUSER/paymentservice docker run --rm -it -p 9999:8080 -e PAYMENTSERVICE=http://\u0026lt;YOUR IP\u0026gt;:9998/api/expected-date/:id $DOCKERHUBUSER/invoiceservice\u0026quot;  Now you can test the flow by running\n# For the payment service curl --request GET --url http://localhost:9998/api/expected-date/1234 # For the invoice service curl --request GET --url http://localhost:9999/api/invoices/1234  For more information and sample messages check out the prebuilt docker images for these services on Docker Hub\n invoiceservice paymentservice  Speaking of Docker Hub\u0026hellip; you can push your docker containers to Docker Hub (assuming you have an account for it) by running\ndocker push $DOCKERHUBUSER/paymentservice:latest docker push $DOCKERHUBUSER/invoiceservice:latest  On to Kubernetes The last step is to deploy to Kubernetes. To do that we need to download two additional files.\ncd $ROOTDIR/$WORKDIR curl -o invoice-svc.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retgits/flogo-components/master/apps/invoiceservice/invoice-svc.yml curl -o payment-svc.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/retgits/flogo-components/master/apps/paymentservice/payment-svc.yml  The payment-svc.yml file will create a deployment and a service resource in your Kubernetes cluster. For that we\u0026rsquo;ll use an existing docker image called retgits/paymentservice, which is the same as the one you just built. If you want you can update the yaml file before running the below command.\nkubectl apply -f payment-svc.yml  You now have a docker container that is accessible as a service on Kubernetes. The payment service is accessible on port 80 of the cluster IP address that was assigned to it. If you want to try it out look for the CLUSTER-IP of the payment-svc in the output from kubectl get services\nkubectl run curl --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty  This will start a new buxybox terminal in your cluster. From there you can run\ncurl \u0026lt;CLUSTERIP\u0026gt;/api/expected-date/3456  which should return something like \u0026quot;{\u0026quot;expectedDate\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2018-02-26\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;3456\u0026quot;}\nThe second service we\u0026rsquo;ll make available using the type: LoadBalancer which means that you can access it from outside your Kubernetes cluster. For this we\u0026rsquo;ll use the existing container retgits/invoiceservice. If you open the invoice.yml file you\u0026rsquo;ll see that there is an environment variable called PAYMENTSERVICE (line 24) which points to the DNS entry for the payment service. This way we can makes updates and potentially move the payment service around without having to update this service.\nkubectl apply -f invoice-svc.yml  Done All done! You now have two Flogo apps running on a Kubernetes cluster which you invoke by sending a curl message to the Kubernetes IP address or localhost if you\u0026rsquo;re running Docker for Mac. You can execute a command like:\ncurl localhost:80/api/invoices/1234  which will return something like \u0026quot;{\u0026quot;amount\u0026quot;:1162,\u0026quot;balance\u0026quot;:718,\u0026quot;currency\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;USD\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;expectedPaymentDate\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2018-03-02\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1234\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;INV-1234\u0026quot;}\u0026quot;\nHappy Kube-ing!!\n"

	"content": " Like with every programming language, a \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; project gets you started with some basic fundamentals and Project Flogo really isn\u0026rsquo;t that different. This lab will get you started with the Flogo Web UI and building a simple flow.\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need The Flogo Web UI This demo makes use of the Flogo Web UI. To make it easy to get started the Flogo Web UI is packaged up as a docker image which you can get from [docker hub](docker hub. To install Docker for your operating system click here for macOS and here for Windows. The Flogo Web UI contains everything you\u0026rsquo;ll need to build your Flogo apps, without ever writing code.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re planning to run on a Windows machine older than Windows 10, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install Docker Toolbox\n Step 1: Starting the Flogo Web UI To get started with the latest version of the Flogo Web UI paste this command in a terminal window:\ndocker run -it -p 3303:3303 flogo/flogo-docker:latest eula-accept  The parameters after the docker run command are:\n -it: This parameter keeps a pseudo-tty terminal open and keeps the terminal running in interactive mode. The Flogo Web Ui will print logs to this terminal window -p 3303:3303: This parameter tells Docker to bind your computer\u0026rsquo;s port 3303 to the container\u0026rsquo;s port 3303 flogo/flogo-docker:latest: This parameter tells the Docker daemon which container you want to run. In this case it will try to get the latest version of flogo/flogo-docker eula-accept: This parameter says you\u0026rsquo;ve accepted the EULA agreement on our website  After it is done starting the container, you\u0026rsquo;ll see something like the image below in your terminal.\nTo see the Flogo Web UI, open your favorite web browser, and navigate to http://localhost:3303. You\u0026rsquo;ll see our mascot Flynn there to greet you!\nStep 2: Create the app In Flogo terminology, an app is comprised of one or more triggers and flows (actions). The app itself is really just an organizational mechanism that can be leveraged when developing microservices \u0026amp; functions. An app contains a set of configurations, as well as triggers and a collection of flows.\nTo create a new app, open the Flogo Web UI and from there, click \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; to create a new microservice and give your new app a name. Click \u0026ldquo;Create a Flow\u0026rdquo; to create a new flow and give it any name that you want. Now click on the flow you just created and to open the canvas where you can design your flow.\nStep 3: Add a flow In Flogo, a flow is an implementation of an action and is the primary tool to implement business logic. A flow can consist of a number of different constructs:\n Activties: One or more activities that implement specific logic (for example write to a database, invoke a REST endpoint, etc) Links: Each activity is connected via a link (Links can contain conditional logic to alter the path of a flow)  Flows, as previously stated in the triggers section, can exist without a trigger. Thus, flows operate very similar to functions, that is, a single flow can define its own input \u0026amp; output parameters. Thus, enabling a flow to be reused regardless of the trigger entrypoint To create a new flow you can click either the + New Flow button at the top or the Create a flow button in the middle of the screen.\nNo matter which you pick, you\u0026rsquo;ll be presented with a dialog to give your new flow a name and an optional description. Click Create to create the new flow and click on the newly created flow to open the editor.\nStep 4: Add a trigger Flogo is an event-driven framework. A trigger is the entrypoint for events to, as the name implies, trigger the functionality of your app. A trigger can be a subscriber on an MQTT topic, Kafka topic, HTTP REST interface or a specific IoT sensor. The trigger is responsible for accepting the incoming event and invoking one or more defined actions (flows).\nTo add a trigger, click on the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; icon on the left hand side of the screen and select the Receive HTTP Message trigger.\nThe thing you want to log comes from the HTTP request. To get that parameter into the flow, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create an Input parameter which you can do by clicking on the grey \u0026ldquo;Input Output\u0026rdquo; bar on your screen. For example, you can call the parameter \u0026ldquo;name\u0026rdquo;, keep the type as \u0026ldquo;string\u0026rdquo; and click save.\nThe response to the HTTP request will be a message and the HTTP status code, and to be able to send data back you\u0026rsquo;ll need to have Output parameters. From the screen where you are now, select Output and configure two parameters:\n Parameter name: code Type: integer  Now click on the + sign to add a new parameter\n Parameter name: message Type: any  Now it is time to configure the trigger to listen to HTTP messages. To start, click on the trigger and a new dialog will open with a bunch of options. In this dialog you\u0026rsquo;ll have to provide:\n Port: The port on which your app will listen (set this to 9233) Method: The HTTP method that will trigger this flow (set this to GET) Path: The path that will route the messages to this flow (set this to /test/:name, the :name means that you can use that as a path parameter in your mappings).  The URL on which our microservice will listen will be http://localhost:9233/test/:name (the :name is a parameter that you can replace with anything during runtime). If you made changes to any of the variables above, please make sure to change those in the rest of these examples.\n Step 5: Adding activities An activity is the unit of work that can be leveraged within a Flow. An activity can be any number of things and can be compared to a simple function in Go or any other procedural language, that is, an activity accepts input params and will return one or more objects on return, both input \u0026amp; output params are defined by the activity metadata. You’ll have to add some acvitivities to the flow for it to do something. To add an activity click on the large + sign\nA list with all the activities the Flogo Web UI knows about will appear. From the list you can pick the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity (or use the searchbar to find it) and click it to make sure it is added to the flow. As you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In this window you can configure the inputs of the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity. Click on \u0026ldquo;a.. message\u0026rdquo; and type (or copy/paste) string.concat(\u0026quot;Hello \u0026quot;, $flow.name) in the box (on the right hand side of the screen).\nStep 6: Return data To complete the app, add a Return activity. To add an activity click on the large + sign.\nHover over the newly added activity to see the cog and select configure to bring up the modal to configure the activity. The return activity is always the last activity in a branch and sets the values that are returned to the trigger. Click on \u0026ldquo;123 code\u0026rdquo; and type 200 in the input field to set the HTTP Response code to 200. Now click on \u0026ldquo;a.. message\u0026rdquo; and type string.concat(\u0026quot;Hello \u0026quot;, $flow.name) in the input field. Finally click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; to complete the mapping.\nStep 7: Build Those were all the steps needed to design the flow, now let\u0026rsquo;s build an executable from it. On the main screen of your flow click on the \u0026lt; button on the top-left hand side of the screen. Click on build and select your operating system of choice! Flogo will compile a statically linked binary, meaning that there are no other dependencies that the executable you\u0026rsquo;re getting from the Flogo Web UI. No libraries to install, no frameworks to maintain or upgrade, just that one single binary that takes care of your flows.\nProject Flogo can build binaries for most platforms that exist. If you choose to build one for a unix based system (e.g. Linux or macOS) be sure to add the executable property to it (chmod +x \u0026lt;executable\u0026gt;).\n Step 8: Run your app To run the app double-click it (on Windows), or open a terminal and execute the downloaded binary. As you\u0026rsquo;ll do that, you\u0026rsquo;ll not only see the output of the log step, but you\u0026rsquo;ll see the same in your browser window as well. The URL on which our microservice will listen should be http://localhost:9233/test/:name (or might be different if you made changes in the previous steps). If you\u0026rsquo;re running it on your machine you can open a browser window and go to http://localhost:9233/test/flogo to see what the output was (spoiler alert: you\u0026rsquo;ll see \u0026quot;Hello flogo\u0026quot; in your web browser). To stop your app simply close the terminal window in which you started the app or press ctrl + c\n"

Use this lab to get familiar with some of the concepts of Flogo!\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need The Flogo Web UI This demo makes use of the Flogo Web UI. To make it easy to get started the Flogo Web UI is packaged up as a docker image which you can get from docker hub. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have that one running yet, please check out Getting Started with the Flogo Web UI. The Flogo Web UI contains everything you\u0026rsquo;ll need to build your Flogo apps, without ever writing code.\nStep 1: Create the app In Flogo terminology, an app is comprised of one or more triggers and flows (actions). The app itself is really just an organizational mechanism that can be leveraged when developing microservices \u0026amp; functions.

The trigger is responsible for accepting the incoming event and invoking one or more defined actions (flows).\nIn this case you want to start with a Timer. To add a trigger, click on the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; icon on the left hand side of the screen and select the Timer trigger.\nNow it is time to configure the trigger. To start, click on the trigger and a new dialog will open with a bunch of options. In this dialog you\u0026rsquo;ll have to provide:\n repeating: This tells the trigger wheter it should stop after executing once, or repeat itself after a certain interval (set this to true) notImmediate: This tells the trigger to wait until tehe first interval is done or start right away (set this to false) startDate: You can specify what the start date is for the trigger to become active, for example if you want to deploy the app and want it to start in a few hours (keep this at 2018-01-01T12:00:00Z00:00) hours: This will tell the trigger how many hours to wait between runs (keep this field empty) minutes: This will tell the trigger how many minutes to wait between runs (keep this field empty) seconds: This will tell the trigger how many seconds to wait between runs (set this to 5, to start a new flow every 5 seconds)  Click \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo; to make sure everything is, well…, saved. You can click the little X on the top-right (no, not your browser…) to close the dialog window and go back to the flow.\nStep 3: Add activities An activity is the unit of work that can be leveraged within a Flow. An activity can be any number of things and can be compared to a simple function in Go or any other procedural language, that is, an activity accepts input params and will return one or more objects on return, both input \u0026amp; output params are defined by the activity metadata.

In this window you can configure the inputs of the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity. Click on \u0026ldquo;a.. message\u0026rdquo; and type Hello World in the box (on the right hand side of the screen).\nWith all the updates, your flow should look something like the one below.\nStep 4: Build Those were all the steps needed to design the flow, now let\u0026rsquo;s build an executable from it. On the main screen of your flow click on the \u0026lt; button on the top-left hand side of the screen. Click on build and select your operating system of choice!

The project-flogo/developers Developer/contributor focused conversations.  Step 1: Create the app Open the Flogo Web UI and from there, click \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; to create a new microservice and give your new app a name. Click \u0026ldquo;Create a Flow\u0026rdquo; to create a new flow and give it any name that you want. Now click on the flow you just created and to open the canvas where you can design your flow.\nStep 2: Add a trigger Triggers are used to signal a flow to run. In this case you want to receive an HTTP message to generate the date. To add a trigger, click on the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; icon on the left hand side of the screen and select the Receive HTTP Message trigger.\nThe invoice ID for which you need to generate a date comes from the HTTP request. To get that parameter into the flow, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create an Input parameter which you can do by clicking on the grey \u0026ldquo;Input Output\u0026rdquo; bar on your screen. For example, you can call the parameter \u0026ldquo;invoiceid\u0026rdquo;, keep the type as \u0026ldquo;string\u0026rdquo; and click save.\nThe response to the HTTP request will be a message and the HTTP status code, and to be able to send data back you\u0026rsquo;ll need to have Output parameters. You can create them by clicking on the grey \u0026ldquo;Input Output\u0026rdquo; bar on your screen. From there, select Output and configure two parameters:\n Parameter name: code Type: integer  Now click on the + sign to add a new parameter\n Parameter name: response Type: any  Now it is time to configure the trigger to listen to HTTP messages. To start, click on the trigger and a new dialog will open with a bunch of options. In this dialog you\u0026rsquo;ll have to provide:\n Port: The port on which your app will listen (set this to 9233) Method: The HTTP method that will trigger this flow (set this to GET) Path: The path that will route the messages to this flow (set this to /api/expected-date/:invoiceId, the :invoiceId means that you can use that as a path parameter in your mappings)  After that, click on \u0026ldquo;Map to flow inputs\u0026rdquo; to map the invoiceId from the HTTP trigger to the \u0026ldquo;invoiceid\u0026rdquo; parameter we created earlier. The parameter will already be selected because it is the only one. Since the data will come from the PATH parameters, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to type $.pathParams.invoiceId in the input box, which means the Flogo app will expect a PATH parameter called invoiceId to be present.\nWith the inputs taken care off, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the outputs. Click on \u0026ldquo;Map to flow outputs\u0026rdquo; to map the output parameters you created earlier to the response of the trigger. The code parameter will already be selected, so click on \u0026ldquo;123 code\u0026rdquo; in the Flow Output section to create the mapping. Now click on \u0026ldquo;response\u0026rdquo; in the Trigger Response section and select \u0026ldquo;* data\u0026rdquo; from the Flow Output section to create the mapping. Click \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo; to make sure everything is, well…, saved. You can click the little X on the top-right (no, not your browser…) to close the dialog window and go back to the flow.\nThe URL on which our microservice will listen will be http://localhost:9233/api/expected-date/:invoiceId (the :invoiceId is a parameter that you can replace with anything during runtime). If you made changes to any of the variables above, please make sure to change those in the rest of these examples.\n Step 3: Add activities You’ll have to add some acvitivities to the flow for it to do something. To add an activity click on the large + sign\nA list with all the activities the Flogo Web UI knows about will appear. The activity that is needed, to generate a random number, isn\u0026rsquo;t part of the out-of-the-box activities so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to import it. Click \u0026ldquo;Install new activity\u0026rdquo; and a dialog appears where you can paste (or type) the URL of where the Flogo Web UI can get the sources. For this activity you can use https://github.com/retgits/flogo-components/activity/randomnumber. From the updated list you can pick the \u0026ldquo;Random number\u0026rdquo; activity (or use the searchbar to find it) and click it to make sure it is added to the flow. As you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In this window you can configure the inputs of the \u0026ldquo;Random number\u0026rdquo; activity.\n max: 10 (the maximum value the random number will have) min: 0 (the minimum value the random number will have)  In the same way, add a new activity and this time install the \u0026ldquo;Add to date\u0026rdquo; activity to add a number of days to the current date. The URL you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use to install the activity is https://github.com/retgits/flogo-components/activity/addtodate.\nFrom the updated list you can pick the \u0026ldquo;Add to date\u0026rdquo; activity (or use the searchbar to find it) and click it to make sure it is added to the flow. As you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In this window you can configure the inputs of the \u0026ldquo;Add to date\u0026rdquo; activity.\n date: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; (leave this blank, which means using the current date) units: \u0026quot;days\u0026quot; (this means you\u0026rsquo;ll add days. Other possible values are \u0026quot;years\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;months\u0026quot;)  For the number you\u0026rsquo;ll need to perform a mapping. Select the activity input \u0026ldquo;number\u0026rdquo; and click on the grey carret next to the Random Number activity in the \u0026ldquo;Available Data\u0026rdquo; list. This will display a list of all the outputs from that activity and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to click on \u0026ldquo;result\u0026rdquo; to populate the input box with the value of that field. As your app is running, it will mean the output of that activity will be passed in as the input for this one.\nStep 4: Return data To complete the flow, add a Return activity. Hover over it to see the cog and select configure to bring up the modal to configure the activity. The return activity is always the last activity in a branch and sets the values that are returned to the trigger. Click on \u0026ldquo;123 code\u0026rdquo; and type 200 in the input field to set the HTTP Response code to 200.\nNow click on \u0026ldquo;* message\u0026rdquo; and type (or copy) the structure below. Finally click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; to complete the mapping.\n{\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;{{$flow.invoiceid}}\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;expectedDate\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;{{$activity[addtodate_3].result}}\u0026quot;}  The above snippet maps the values from the REST service to fields that are sent back to the trigger. The mapping is done in a JavaScript-like syntax, so $flow.invoiceid means it will get the invoiceId that was used as an input parameter to the flow (the one you configured earlier) and the $activity[addtodate_3].result will get the result from the \u0026ldquo;Add to date\u0026rdquo; activity. The double curly braces are used as by Go\u0026rsquo;s templating engine.\nYour final flow should look something like the one below.\nStep 5: Build Those were all the steps needed to design the flow, now let\u0026rsquo;s build an executable from it. On the main screen of your flow click on the \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;\u0026rdquo; button on the top-left hand side of the screen. That will bring you back to your microservice and from here you can select \u0026ldquo;Build\u0026rdquo;. Choose whichever operating system you\u0026rsquo;re running on to download the executable.\nStep 6: Run To see the results, start your app and run curl --request GET --url http://localhost:9233/api/expected-date/12345. That will give you a result like\n{\u0026quot;expectedDate\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2018-10-01\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:12345}  "

	"content": " Building microservices is awesome, having them talk to each other is even more awesome! But in today\u0026rsquo;s world, you can\u0026rsquo;t be too careful when it comes to sending sensitive data across the wire. In this demo you explore how to build a simple microservice to receive the messages from PubNub and write that data to a file.\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need The Flogo Web UI This demo makes use of the Flogo Web UI. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have that one running yet, please check out Getting Started with the Flogo Web UI\nA PubNub account In order to work with PubNub, you\u0026rsquo;ll really need a PubNub account. Luckily, registration is very easy. Go to https://dashboard.pubnub.com/login and use \u0026ldquo;SIGN UP\u0026rdquo; to create a new account.\nStep 1: Create an app in PubNub After signing up, use the big red button to create a new app (the name doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, and if you want you can change it later too). Now click on the newly created app and you\u0026rsquo;ll see a new KeySet. The Publish and Subscriber key are quite important as they make sure you can connect to your PubNub account.\nStep 2: Create an an in the Flogo Web UI Open the Flogo Web UI and from there, click \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; to create a new microservice and give your new app a name. Click \u0026ldquo;Create a Flow\u0026rdquo; to create a new flow and give it any name that you want. Now click on the flow you just created and to open the canvas where you can design your flow.\nStep 3: Import a new trigger Out of the box, Flogo doesn\u0026rsquo;t come with a trigger for PubNub so using the awesome SDK provided by the PubNub team we\u0026rsquo;ve built one for you! To install that into your Web UI, click on the + icon on the left hand side of the screen.\nFrom there click on \u0026ldquo;Install new\u0026rdquo; and paste \u0026ldquo;https://github.com/retgits/flogo-components/trigger/pubnubsubscriber\u0026rdquo; into the input dialog to get this new trigger. After the installation is completed, you can click on \u0026ldquo;Receive PubNub messages\u0026rdquo; to add the trigger to your app.\nStep 4: Configuration The thing we want to store in a file is the message coming from PubNub. To do so, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create an Input parameter which you can do by clicking on the grey \u0026ldquo;Input Output\u0026rdquo; bar on your screen. For example, you can call the parameter \u0026ldquo;pubnubmessage\u0026rdquo;, keep the type as \u0026ldquo;string\u0026rdquo; and click save.\nNow it is time to configure the trigger to listen to messages coming from PubNub. To start, click on the trigger and a new dialog will open with a bunch of options. In this dialog you\u0026rsquo;ll have to provide:\n publishKey: The key from PubNub (usually starts with pub-c) subscribeKey: The key from PubNub (usually starts with sub-c) channel: The channel on which messages will come (totally up to you to choose this)  After that, click on \u0026ldquo;Map to flow inputs\u0026rdquo; to map the message from PubNub to the \u0026ldquo;pubnubmessage\u0026rdquo; parameter we created earlier. The parameter will already be selected because it is the only one, so the only task left is to click \u0026ldquo;* message\u0026rdquo; in the Trigger Output section and \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo; to make sure everything is, well…, saved. You can click the little X on the top-right (no, not your browser…) to close the dialog window and go back to the flow.\nStep 5: Adding activities You’ll have to add some acvitivities to the flow for it to do something. In this demo you\u0026rsquo;ll add two activities to the flow. The first activity will log the message and the second one will store the data in a file. To add an activity click on the other large + sign\nOn the right-hand side of the screen a list with all the activities the Flogo Web UI knows about will appear. From the list you can pick the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity and click it to make sure it is added to the flow. As you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In this window you can configure the inputs of the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity using data from all other activities and triggers in your flow. Right now, we have only the incoming data from PubNub so select \u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;Activity Inputs\u0026rdquo; section and expand the \u0026ldquo;flow (flow)\u0026rdquo; section (by clicking on the little black caret) to be able to select the \u0026ldquo;pubnubmessage\u0026rdquo;.\nNow hit the \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo; button and we\u0026rsquo;re done with this part!\nNow we need to add a new activity to the Flogo Web UI to make sure you can add things to a file. Add a new activity, like you did before, and click \u0026ldquo;Install new activity\u0026rdquo; to get the same dialog as when installing the trigger.\nIn the dialog window you can paste \u0026ldquo;https://github.com/retgits/flogo-components/activity/writetofile\u0026rdquo;. Once the activity is installed you can select it from the list to add it to your flow. Again, hover over the newly added activity and expand the menu to configure your activity. For this activity you\u0026rsquo;ll have to configure all the parameters:\n Append: Should the content be appended to the file or not? In this case we want to, so type \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; in the box Content: The content we want to add to the file. In this case it is the message from PubNub again, so expand the \u0026ldquo;flow (flow)\u0026rdquo; section (by clicking on the little black caret) and select the \u0026ldquo;pubnubmessage\u0026rdquo; Create: Should the file be created if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist? Well, yes, in this case that is probably a good idea so type \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; in the box Filename: The name of the file you want to write the data to. In this case you can call the file whatever you want, like \u0026ldquo;visitors.txt\u0026rdquo; (please be sure to add the double quotes as you type in the box)  Click \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo; to save the data and return to the main screen of your flow. The completed flow will look like\nStep 6: Build Those were all the steps needed to design the flow, now let\u0026rsquo;s build an executable from it. On the main screen of your flow click on the \u0026lt; button on the top-left hand side of the screen. That will bring you back to your microservice and from here you can select \u0026ldquo;Build\u0026rdquo; and choose your operating system of choice. That will tell the Flogo Web UI to go build your microservice and give you a tiny executable in return (about 12mb).\nStep 7: Test You can run your microservice by either double-clicking it (on Windows) or using a terminal window to run your app (macOS or Linux). If the app started successfully it will give you a message like: 2018-08-06 21:20:02.867 INFO [engine] - Received status [pubnub.PNConnectedCategory], this is expected for a subscribe, this means there is no error or issue whatsoever\nTo test the microservice you can use the PubNub debug console.\nIn the \u0026ldquo;Default Channel\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;ll have to type the same channel name as you configured in your Flogo app (MyChannel, in this example). You can click \u0026ldquo;ADD CLIENT\u0026rdquo; to create a new client which will be able to send and receive data. The cool thing that PubNub offers, is that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to open any firewall ports to have the debug console and the microservice talk to each other. At the bottom of the page it will now say {\u0026quot;text\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Enter Message Here\u0026quot;}, which is the message that you can send to your microservice. Either hit \u0026ldquo;SEND\u0026rdquo; or perhaps replace the default message with something like {\u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;World\u0026quot;}. After you click \u0026ldquo;SEND\u0026rdquo; the exact message will appear in the window where your microservice is running\nAnd in the log file that was created in the same location as your app\n"

	"content": " A Raspberry Pi is probably one of the most well-known small single-board computers built to promote the teaching of basic computer science, and increasingly used for cool IoT projects. Flogo runs perfectly on these small devices, and in this lab you\u0026rsquo;ll build a sample to read and write data to the GPIO pins of the device\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need The Flogo Web UI This demo makes use of the Flogo Web UI. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have that one running yet, please check out Getting Started with the Flogo Web UI\nDevices You\u0026rsquo;ll definitely want to have a Raspberry Pi, to run the app!\nStep 1: Create the app Open the Flogo Web UI and from there, click \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; to create a new microservice and give your new app a name. Click \u0026ldquo;Create a Flow\u0026rdquo; to create a new flow and give it any name that you want. Now click on the flow you just created and to open the canvas where you can design your flow.\nStep 2: Add a trigger Triggers are used to signal a flow to run. In this case you want to receive an HTTP message to turn on or off the lights. To add a trigger, click on the + icon on the left hand side of the screen and select the Receive HTTP Message trigger.\nThe response to the HTTP request will be a message and the HTTP status code, and to be able to send data back you\u0026rsquo;ll need to have Output parameters. You can create them by clicking on the grey \u0026ldquo;Input Output\u0026rdquo; bar on your screen. From there, select Output and configure two parameters:\n Parameter name: code Type: integer  Now click on the + sign to add a new parameter\n Parameter name: message Type: string  Now it is time to configure the trigger to listen to HTTP messages. To start, click on the trigger and a new dialog will open with a bunch of options. In this dialog you\u0026rsquo;ll have to provide:\n Port: The port on which your app will listen (set this to 9233) Method: The HTTP method that will trigger this flow (set this to GET) Path: The path that will route the messages to this flow (this can be anything, like /light/status)  After that, click on \u0026ldquo;Map to flow outputs\u0026rdquo; to map the output parameters you created earlier to the response of the trigger. The code parameter will already be selected, so click on \u0026ldquo;123 code\u0026rdquo; in the Flow Output section to create the mapping. Now click on \u0026ldquo;message\u0026rdquo; in the Trigger Response section and select \u0026ldquo;* data\u0026rdquo; from the Flow Output section to create the mapping. Click \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo; to make sure everything is, well…, saved. You can click the little X on the top-right (no, not your browser…) to close the dialog window and go back to the flow.\nStep 3: Add activities You’ll have to add some acvitivities to the flow for it to do something. To add an activity click on the other large + sign\nA list with all the activities the Flogo Web UI knows about will appear. From the list you can pick the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity (or use the searchbar to find it) and click it to make sure it is added to the flow. As you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In this window you can configure the inputs of the \u0026ldquo;Log Message\u0026rdquo; activity. Click on \u0026ldquo;a.. message\u0026rdquo; and type Received request. in the box (on the right hand side of the screen).\nIn the same way you just added the Log activity, now add a Control GPIO activity and configure it in the same way with:\n method: Direction pinNumber: 23 direction: Output  This will tell the app you\u0026rsquo;ll want to use pin number 23.\nAdd another Control GPIO activity and configure it in the same way with:\n method: Read State pinNumber: 23  This will tell the app you want to know the output state of pin number 23.\nYour flow should look something like the one below.\nStep 4: Adding a branch To be able to switch from on to off and vice versa, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create two branches. One that turns off the light if it was on and one that does the opposite. You\u0026rsquo;ll start by creating the \u0026ldquo;Turn it on\u0026rdquo; branch.\nAs you hover over the activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to create a branch from your activity.\nClick anywhere on the branch to be able to set a condition. The condition is a JavaScript-like syntax $activity[gpio_4].result==0. You can create the condition by simply typing it into the textbox. Where it says gpio_4 in the condition, you might need to change that to match the ID of the activity you added last (it will have the name \u0026ldquo;Control GPIO(2)\u0026rdquo;).\nAdd a new Log Message activity (click on the + right behind the created branch) and as you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In the modal that now appears, select \u0026ldquo;a.. message\u0026rdquo; to tell the app what the message is that will be logged. Now click on the caret next to the second GPIO activity to expand it and click \u0026ldquo;123 result\u0026rdquo; to tell the app to map the result from that activity to the message that will be logged.\nAdd another Control GPIO activity (yes, a lot of GPIO activities are used in this flow\u0026hellip;) and configure it in the same way you did with the previous activities, but with the values:\n method: Set State pinNumber: 23 state: high  To complete the branch, add a Return activity. Hover over it to see the cog and select configure to bring up the modal to configure the activity. The return activity is always the last activity in a branch and sets the values that are returned to the trigger. Click on \u0026ldquo;123 code\u0026rdquo; and type 200 in the input field to set the HTTP Response code to 200.\nNow click on \u0026ldquo;a.. message\u0026rdquo; and type \u0026ldquo;Updated light to high successfully\u0026rdquo; (the quotes are needed). Finally click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; to complete the mapping.\nWith all the updates, your flow should look something like the one below.\nStep 5: Adding another branch To create the second branch, the \u0026ldquo;Turn it off\u0026rdquo; branch, select the activity from which you created the first branch. Create a branch in the same way, by hovering over the activity first. As you hover over the activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to create a branch from your activity.\nClick anywhere on the branch to be able to set a condition. This time, set the condition to $activity[gpio_4].result==1. Where it says gpio_4 in the condition, you might need to change that to match the ID of the activity you added last (it will have the name \u0026ldquo;Control GPIO(2)\u0026rdquo;).\nAdd a new Log Message activity (click on the + right behind the newly created branch) and as you hover over the newly added activity, a cog will appear and as you hover over that thing, a menu will appear to configure your activity. In the modal that now appears, select \u0026ldquo;a.. message\u0026rdquo; to tell the app what the message is that will be logged. Now click on the caret next to the second GPIO activity to expand it and click \u0026ldquo;123 result\u0026rdquo; to tell the app to map the result from that activity to the message that will be logged.\nAdd a Control GPIO activity (we promise, this is the last GPIO activity\u0026hellip;) and configure it in the same way you did with the previous activities, but with the values:\n method: Set State pinNumber: 23 state: low  This branch should be completed with a Return activity as well. Hover over it to see the cog and select configure to bring up the modal to configure the activity. Click on \u0026ldquo;123 code\u0026rdquo; and type 200 in the input field to set the HTTP Response code to 200 and this time set the field \u0026ldquo;a.. message\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Updated light to low successfully\u0026rdquo; (the quotes are needed). Finally click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; to complete the mapping.\nWith all the updates, your final flow should look something like the one below.\nStep 6: Build Those were all the steps needed to design the flow, now let\u0026rsquo;s build an executable from it. On the main screen of your flow click on the \u0026lt; button on the top-left hand side of the screen. That will bring you back to your microservice and from here you can select \u0026ldquo;Build\u0026rdquo; and choose linux/arm to make sure it is capable of running on a Raspberry Pi.\nStep 7: Run To run your app copy it to your Raspberry Pi and run curl --request GET --url http://localhost:9233/lights/status (or replace localhost with the IP address of your device)\n"

	"content": " Building serverless apps is awesome! As a developer you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about provisioning or maintaining servers, and you only have to create the code that you need to power your next business idea! Deploying such apps is made super easy by the team at Serverless Framework.With the Serverless Framework, you can configure which events should trigger it, where to deploy it and what kind of resources it is allowed to use without going into the AWS console.\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need Serverless Framework You\u0026rsquo;ll need to have the Serverless Framework installed. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t done that yet, now would be a great time to do so!\nAWS account To finally deploy your apps you\u0026rsquo;ll need an AWS account. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t signed up yet, this would be a great time to do that too.\nStep 1: Using the template The first step is to create a sample project based on the Flogo template.\nserverless create -u https://github.com/tibcosoftware/flogo/tree/master/serverless -p myservice  That command just generated a bunch of files for you\nmyservice \u0026lt;-- A new directory with the name of your service ├── hello \u0026lt;-- A folder with the sources of your function │ ├── function.go \u0026lt;-- A Hello World function │ └── main.go \u0026lt;-- The Lambda trigger code, created by Flogo ├── .gitignore \u0026lt;-- A .gitignore file to ignore the things you don't want in git ├── Makefile \u0026lt;-- A Makefile to build and deploy even faster ├── README.md \u0026lt;-- A quickstart guide └── serverless.yaml \u0026lt;-- The Serverless Framework template  The content of main.go comes directly from the Lambda trigger. The function.go file has three methods that make up the entire app\n init: The init method makes sure that everything is ready to go. It sets the default loglevels, creates an app by calling shimApp() and ultimately starts the engine shimApp: shimApp is used to build a new Flogo app and register the Lambda trigger with the engine. The shimapp is used by the shim, which triggers the engine every time an event comes into Lambda. It registers the method that it should call each time and in this case that method is RunActivities RunActivities: RunActivities is where the magic happens. This is where you get the input from any event that might trigger your Lambda function in a map called evt (which is part of the inputs). The sample will simply log \u0026ldquo;Go Serverless v1.x! Your function executed successfully!\u0026rdquo; and return the same as a response. The trigger, in main.go, will take care of marshalling it into a proper response for the API Gateway  Step 2: Build and Deploy To build the executable that you want to deploy to Lambda, you can run make or make build. That command, in turn, executes two other commands:\n go generate ./...: In order to run the activities and triggers that you have uses, the Flogo engine needs to have all the metadata available. This command generates the metadata so that it can be compiled into the executable env GOOS=linux go build -ldflags=\u0026quot;-s -w\u0026quot; -o bin/hello hello/*.go: This command creates the executable (which should run on Linux) from the sources in the hello folder and stores the result (a file called hello) in the bin folder.  To deploy the app run make deploy or, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use make, run sls deploy --verbose to get the same result. This command will deploy your function to AWS Lambda.\nThe output on your screen will have something like what is pasted below:\n\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; Service Information service: myservice stage: dev region: us-east-1 stack: myservice-dev api keys: None endpoints: GET - https://xxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello functions: hello: myservice-dev-hello \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt;  Step 3: Test it Using cURL you can test your new function\ncurl --request GET --url https://xxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello --header 'content-type: application/json'  The above command will call your function and return a result:\n{\u0026quot;message\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Go Serverless v1.x! Your function executed successfully!\u0026quot;}  Step 4: Adding a POST operation That was pretty easy, and pretty cool, but not really useful. The next step is all about updating the code to not only handle GET, but also POST operations and provide a more personalized response.\nThe first thing is to update the serverless.yml file with a new event handler. Around line 58 of the file you\u0026rsquo;ll find the events and the types of events that can trigger your app. It already has an entry for GET, copy and paste that and change the method to POST.\nfunctions: hello: handler: bin/hello events: - http: path: hello method: get - http: path: hello method: post  Step 5: Build the code The second part is to update the RunActivities method. In this step you\u0026rsquo;ll walk through the entire method.\nIn order to distinguish the two HTTP methods, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to look at the httpMethod element of the incoming message:\n// Get the HTTP method from the event method := inputs[\u0026quot;evt\u0026quot;].Value().(map[string]interface{})[\u0026quot;httpMethod\u0026quot;].(string) // Create a variable for the message var message string // Decide which way to take switch method { case \u0026quot;GET\u0026quot;: case \u0026quot;POST\u0026quot;: }  Creating the response, so after the switch statement is completed, will still be the same:\n// Using a Flogo activity to log the message in := map[string]interface{}{\u0026quot;message\u0026quot;: message} _, err := flogo.EvalActivity(\u0026amp;log.LogActivity{}, in) if err != nil { return nil, err } // The response from the Lambda function is always in the form of a JSON message. // In this case we're creating a structure with a single element called // message responseData := make(map[string]interface{}) responseData[\u0026quot;message\u0026quot;] = message // Because we're sending the result back to the API Gateway, it will expect to have // both an HTTP result code (called code) and some response data. In this case we're // sending back the data object we created earlier response := make(map[string]*data.Attribute) response[\u0026quot;code\u0026quot;], _ = data.NewAttribute(\u0026quot;code\u0026quot;, data.TypeInteger, 200) response[\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;], _ = data.NewAttribute(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, data.TypeAny, responseData) return response, nil  In case of a GET operation, the message should still be the same. You can update the GET part by pasting in message = \u0026quot;Go Serverless v1.x! Your function executed successfully!\u0026quot;\nIn case of a POST operation, the message will be a little different. In that case you want to reply with the name of the person that called your function.\n// API Gateway passes in the body as a string, so the first step // is to parse the body to a JON object, or map[string]interface{} in Go var eventBody map[string]interface{} if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(inputs[\u0026quot;evt\u0026quot;].Value().(map[string]interface{})[\u0026quot;body\u0026quot;].(string)), \u0026amp;eventBody); err != nil { return nil, err } // The message you want to log message = fmt.Sprintf(\u0026quot;%v is going all in on Serverless v1.x!\u0026quot;, eventBody[\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;])  Putting everything together, the new method will look like\n// Get the HTTP method from the event method := inputs[\u0026quot;evt\u0026quot;].Value().(map[string]interface{})[\u0026quot;httpMethod\u0026quot;].(string) // Create a variable for the message var message string // Decide which way to take switch method { case \u0026quot;GET\u0026quot;: message = \u0026quot;Go Serverless v1.x! Your function executed successfully!\u0026quot; case \u0026quot;POST\u0026quot;: // API Gateway passes in the body as a string, so the first step // is to parse the body to a JON object, or map[string]interface{} in Go var eventBody map[string]interface{} if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(inputs[\u0026quot;evt\u0026quot;].Value().(map[string]interface{})[\u0026quot;body\u0026quot;].(string)), \u0026amp;eventBody); err != nil { return nil, err } // The message you want to log message = fmt.Sprintf(\u0026quot;%v is going all in on Serverless v1.x!\u0026quot;, eventBody[\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;]) } // Using a Flogo activity to log the message in := map[string]interface{}{\u0026quot;message\u0026quot;: message} _, err := flogo.EvalActivity(\u0026amp;log.LogActivity{}, in) if err != nil { return nil, err } // The response from the Lambda function is always in the form of a JSON message. // In this case we're creating a structure with a single element called // message responseData := make(map[string]interface{}) responseData[\u0026quot;message\u0026quot;] = message // Because we're sending the result back to the API Gateway, it will expect to have // both an HTTP result code (called code) and some response data. In this case we're // sending back the data object we created earlier response := make(map[string]*data.Attribute) response[\u0026quot;code\u0026quot;], _ = data.NewAttribute(\u0026quot;code\u0026quot;, data.TypeInteger, 200) response[\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;], _ = data.NewAttribute(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, data.TypeAny, responseData) return response, nil  Step 6: Build and Deploy To build and deploy the updates you can use one command: make deploy. This command will build the new executable and deploy your function to AWS Lambda.\nThe output on your screen will have something like what is pasted below:\n\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; Service Information service: myservice stage: dev region: us-east-1 stack: myservice-dev api keys: None endpoints: GET - https://xxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello POST - https://xxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello functions: hello: myservice-dev-hello \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt;  Step 7: Test it\u0026hellip; again Using cURL you can test that your function still works for a GET operation. The command\ncurl --request GET --url https://xxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello --header 'content-type: application/json'  Should still respond with:\n{\u0026quot;message\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Go Serverless v1.x! Your function executed successfully!\u0026quot;}  When you POST a message, though\ncurl --request POST --url https://xxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello --header 'content-type: application/json' --data '{\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Flogo\u0026quot;}'  The result should be different\n{\u0026quot;message\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Flogo is going all in on Serverless v1.x!\u0026quot;}  "

	"content": " Project Flogo is an ultra-light, Go-based open source ecosystem for building event-driven apps. It provides a bunch of capabilities to build those apps, like:\n Integration Flows: Application Integration process engine with conditional branching and a visual development environment Stream Processing: a simple pipeline-based stream processing action with event joining capabilities across multiple triggers \u0026amp; aggregation over time windows Contextual Decisioning: Declarative Rules for Real-time Contextual Decisions  In this tutorial you will learn how to use the Stream Processing capability in Flogo\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need Flogo CLI This demo makes use of the Flogo CLI. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have that one running yet, please check out Getting Started with the Flogo CLI\nNeed help If you have any questions, feel free to post an issue on GitHub and tag it as a question or chat with the team and community:\n The project-flogo/Lobby Start here for all things Flogo! The project-flogo/developers Developer/contributor focused conversations.  Step 1: Prepare the app The first step to create a Flogo streams app is to create a quick, barebones Flogo app using the Flogo CLI. Using the Flogo CLI, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to specify that it should get the master branch of both flogo-lib to make sure you can build a streaming app correctly. The command to execute is\nflogo create -flv \u0026lt;branch you need\u0026gt; \u0026lt;appname\u0026gt;  So in your case, using the name aggregator, the command will be\nflogo create -flv github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log@master,github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/app/resource@master aggregator  Step 2: Create the JSON file Open up the flogo.json file that was created in the aggregator directory and delete all the contents. For this tutorial, you\u0026rsquo;ll be guided through the different sections of the flogo.json and what they mean:\n Trigger Action Resources Stages  General stuff Before you can get to define the app, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to define some metadata that the app model needs as well. The fields name, type, version, and appModel describe the metadata of the app and the JSON model you\u0026rsquo;re building through this tutorial. For this tutorial, that part of the file will look like:\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;aggregator\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;flogo:app\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0.0.1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;appModel\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.0.0\u0026quot;, }  Trigger Flogo is an event-driven framework. A trigger is the entrypoint for events. A trigger can be a subscriber on an MQTT topic, Kafka topic, HTTP REST interface or a specific IoT sensor. The trigger is responsible for accepting the incoming event and invoking one or more defined actions. In this case, the trigger will be the REST trigger that comes out-of-the-box with Flogo. The trigger has a bunch of configurations that are important:\n It will listen on port 9234 It will have a GET method registered for the endpoint /aggregate/:val As messages come in, it will call an action with id simple_agg The input to that action is a parameter called input and is assigned the value of the PATH parameter val  Since there could be multiple triggers, the triggers element is an array. In this tutorial, though, you\u0026rsquo;ll only use one REST trigger\n{ \u0026quot;triggers\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;receive_http_message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/trigger/rest\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Receive HTTP Message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;port\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;9234\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;handlers\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;method\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;GET\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/aggregate/:val\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;action\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;simple_agg\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mappings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;assign\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.pathParams.val\u0026quot; } ] } } } ] } ] }  Action An action is a generic implementation for processing the incoming event. Different types of actions can be implemented, thus defining different methods by which an incoming event can be processed. In your case, a pipeline is needed (which is implemented by the github.com/project-flogo/stream action) and it will dispatch the event to the resource with the URI res://pipeline:simple_agg\n{ \u0026quot;actions\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;simple_agg\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/project-flogo/stream\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;pipelineURI\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;res://pipeline:simple_agg\u0026quot; } } ] }  Resources The resources are the actual workhorses of the Flogo app. They define, among a ton of other things, the sequences in which activities have to be executed, rules that need to be followed and parameters that need to be mapped. First, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the metadata of the resource that defines the input and the output. In this case the input is an integer called input and the output is an integer called result.\n{ \u0026quot;resources\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;pipeline:simple_agg\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;metadata\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; } ], \u0026quot;output\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;result\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; } ] }, }  Stages The stages, as the name implies, define the sequential steps that a pipeline needs to perform. The first step is the aggregator activity, which:\n Sums all the inputs Using a time tumbling window of 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) The input to the activity is simply a straight-through mapping of the input parameter  The second activity is a log activity, where the message field is mapped straight from the result field of the aggregator activity. Note that in stream actions, unlike flow actions, only the output of the preceding activity is available and not all other outputs.\n{ \u0026quot;stages\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/aggregate\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;function\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;sum\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;windowType\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;timeTumbling\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;windowSize\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;5000\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;=$.input\u0026quot; } }, { \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;message\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;=$.result\u0026quot; } } ] }  The completed flow The complete flogo.json will look like\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;aggregator\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;flogo:app\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0.0.1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;appModel\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.0.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;triggers\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;receive_http_message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/trigger/rest\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Receive HTTP Message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;port\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;9234\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;handlers\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;method\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;GET\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/aggregate/:val\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;action\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;simple_agg\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mappings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;mapTo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;assign\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;$.pathParams.val\u0026quot; } ] } } } ] } ], \u0026quot;actions\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;simple_agg\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/project-flogo/stream\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;pipelineURI\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;res://pipeline:simple_agg\u0026quot; } } ], \u0026quot;resources\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;pipeline:simple_agg\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;metadata\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; } ], \u0026quot;output\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;result\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; } ] }, \u0026quot;stages\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/aggregate\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;function\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;sum\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;windowType\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;timeTumbling\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;windowSize\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;5000\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;=$.input\u0026quot; } }, { \u0026quot;ref\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;message\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;=$.result\u0026quot; } } ] } } ] }  Step 3: Install dependencies In your app, you\u0026rsquo;re making use of a few external dependencies that you need to install into your app for the Go compiler to be able to successfully build the app. To install external dependencies, you need to run\nflogo install \u0026lt;dependency location\u0026gt;  So in the case of this tutorial, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to run\nflogo install github.com/project-flogo/stream flogo install github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/app/resource flogo install github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/aggregate  Step 4: Build the app The next step is to build the executable.

	"content": " Project Flogo is an ultra-light, Go-based open source ecosystem for building event-driven apps. It provides a bunch of capabilities to build those apps, like:\n Integration Flows: Application Integration process engine with conditional branching and a visual development environment Stream Processing: a simple pipeline-based stream processing action with event joining capabilities across multiple triggers \u0026amp; aggregation over time windows Contextual Decisioning: Declarative Rules for Real-time Contextual Decisions  In this tutorial you will learn how to use the Stream Processing capability in Flogo\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need Flogo CLI This demo makes use of the Flogo CLI. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have that one running yet, please check out Getting Started with the Flogo CLI\nNeed help If you have any questions, feel free to post an issue on GitHub and tag it as a question or chat with the team and community:\n The project-flogo/Lobby Start here for all things Flogo! The project-flogo/developers Developer/contributor focused conversations.  Step 1: Prepare the app The first step to create a Flogo streams app is to create a quick, barebones Flogo app using the Flogo CLI. Using the Flogo CLI, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to specify that it should get the master branch of both flogo-lib to make sure you can build a streaming app correctly. The command to execute is\nflogo create -flv \u0026lt;branch you need\u0026gt; \u0026lt;appname\u0026gt;  So in your case, using the name streamfilter, the command will be\nflogo create -flv github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib/activity/log@master,github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib/app/resource@master streamfilter  Step 2: Create the JSON file Open up the flogo.json file that was created in the streamfilter directory and delete all the contents. For this tutorial, you\u0026rsquo;ll be guided through the different sections of the flogo.json and what they mean:\n Trigger Action Resources Stages  General stuff Before you can get to define the app, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to define some metadata that the app model needs as well. The fields name, type, version, and appModel describe the metadata of the app and the JSON model you\u0026rsquo;re building through this tutorial. For this tutorial, that part of the file will look like:\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;aggregator\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;flogo:app\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0.0.1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;appModel\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.0.0\u0026quot;, }  Trigger Flogo is an event-driven framework.

Events with a value of 0, will not result in a log message.\ncurl --request GET --url http://localhost:9234/filter/1 curl --request GET --url http://localhost:9234/filter/0 curl --request GET --url http://localhost:9234/filter/1  The above requests will result in the log activity being executed only twice\n2018-10-04 08:16:46.048 INFO [engine] - Engine Starting... 2018-10-04 08:16:46.049 INFO [engine] - Starting Services... 2018-10-04 08:16:46.049 INFO [engine] - Started Services 2018-10-04 08:16:46.049 INFO [engine] - Starting Triggers... 2018-10-04 08:16:46.050 INFO [engine] - Trigger [ receive_http_message ]: Started 2018-10-04 08:16:46.050 INFO [engine] - Triggers Started 2018-10-04 08:16:46.050 INFO [engine] - Engine Started 2018-10-04 08:16:51.514 INFO [trigger-flogo-rest] - Received request for id 'receive_http_message' 2018-10-04 08:16:51.515 INFO [activity-flogo-log] - 1 2018-10-04 08:16:51.530 INFO [trigger-flogo-rest] - Received request for id 'receive_http_message' 2018-10-04 08:16:51.545 INFO [trigger-flogo-rest] - Received request for id 'receive_http_message' 2018-10-04 08:16:51.545 INFO [activity-flogo-log] - 1  "
